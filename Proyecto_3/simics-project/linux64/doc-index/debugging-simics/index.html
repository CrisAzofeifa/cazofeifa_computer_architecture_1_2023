<p>

</p><p>
This document describes some tools that are used to debug Simics, and
modules and software developed by the user that is run with Simics. 
</p><p>
However, due to that wide definition and the numerous use cases the 
purpose of this document is to introduce the basics and provide
a quick-start.
</p><p>
The tools that are described are the module 
<b>state-assertion</b> which comes with the Simics 
installation, the two third party tools,
<code>GDB</code> and <code>Valgrind</code>, and the internal Simics memory
tracking system.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Preventing-Defects">1.1 Preventing Defects</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
A good way to pre-empt troublesome debugging sessions
— which often coincide with critical deadlines —
is the use of efficient testing. <em>Simics Model Builder</em> provides you
with such support, see the <em>Model Builder User's Guide</em>.
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-State-Assertion">2 Using State Assertion</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This chapter describes how to use <b>state-assertion</b>, which
is a module that comes with Simics.
</p><p>
In short, state-assertion is used by running the same configuration in two 
different Simics sessions and comparing the state of the two Simics sessions
at specified intervals. It is
the attributes of the verified objects that are compared and any difference
will instantly cause an alert to the user.
</p><p>
In particular, state-assertion is used to verify checkpointability, which 
is a key feature in Simics and most useful while debugging Simics, user 
modules, or target software.
</p><p>
Furthermore, state-assertion can
be used to find out where the execution begins to differ after changes
in target software or changes in user models.
</p><p>
Simics can be run under state-assertion in two ways: save the evolution
to file and run the second Simics using that file, or, run a second Simics
that receives the states over a network connection.
</p><p>
A short overview for running Simics under state-assertion:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Decide on one or more objects to verify. One or more CPUs are the 
    most common objects to verify, that is since they normally will
    detect any difference, even those caused by devices.
  </li>

  <li>
    Start Simics and either...
    <ul>
      <li>
        start state-assertion right away; or
      </li>
      <li>
        start the state-assertion from a checkpoint.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li>
    Run the simulation past the area to verify and stop.
  </li>

  <li>
    Verify the simulation in the second Simics instance.
  </li>

</ol>

<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Example-Session-Using-File">2.1 Example Session Using File</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Start Simics, load the configuration, either run the simulation to some
point prior to the interesting area to verify and take a checkpoint, or
start state-assertion right away. 
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Setup the session.
    Decide on one or more objects to verify and
    start recording:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module state-assertion</b>
simics&gt; <b>state-assertion-create-file compression = gz file = /tmp/test.sa</b>
Creating file '/tmp/test.sa' with compression 'gz'
[state-assertion] File created successfully.
sa0 created. You probably want to add some objects or memory space now with 
'add' and 'add-mem-lis', then run 'start' to begin the assertion process.
simics&gt; <b>sa0.add obj = "board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]" steps = 1000000</b>
[state-assertion] Added board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0] (x86QSP1) with save type 1<img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
(every 1000000 steps) - version 0.0
simics&gt; <b>sa0.start</b>
[state-assertion] Started
simics&gt; <b>c</b></pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Continue the simulation past the interesting area and stop the simulation.
    Finish state-assertion which will flush the state information to file.
    Finally, quit Simics:
<pre class="jdocu_small">running&gt; <b>stop</b>
simics&gt; <b>sa0.stop</b>
[state-assertion] Stopped
simics&gt; <b>quit</b></pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Start Simics, possibly from the checkpoint you created to begin with, and
    load the recorded state information and start the simulation:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module state-assertion</b>
simics&gt; <b>state-assertion-open-file file = /tmp/test.sa compression = gz</b>
Opening file '/tmp/test.sa' with compression 'gz'
[state-assertion] File opened successfully.
sa0 opened. You should run 'start' to begin the assertion process.
simics&gt; <b>sa0.start</b>
[state-assertion] Added board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0] (x86QSP1) with save type 1<img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
(every 1000000 steps) - version 0.0
[state-assertion] Started
simics&gt; <b>c</b></pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    If all goes well no special output is expected, 
    otherwise attributes that differs 
    are listed with timestamps, for example:
<pre class="jdocu_small">[state-assertion::assert] object: 0 - board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0], timestamp 636000000
Name                             Assert value       Current value
rax                              0x0000000040010100 0x00000000df349d68 &lt;-- diff
rbx                              0x00000000ddc65398 0x00000000ddc50398 &lt;-- diff
...
Difference found while asserting</pre><p>
  </p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Normally you want to start with a large interval, but once a difference is
found, restart the state-assertion at the most recent time to be known as 
correct but this time with <b>steps&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</b> to
pin-point where the difference in states first occurs. Once that is done, 
re-run the last one or two steps with maximum log level to find out what 
is happening during that step and debug the execution normally.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Example-Session-Using-Network">2.2 Example Session Using Network</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Rather than save to file it is possible to run two Simics instances, connected 
over the network, one acting as a "producer" and one as a "consumer":
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Start the "consumer" Simics instance and prepare for state-assertion:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics2&gt; <b>load-module state-assertion</b>
simics2&gt; <b>state-assertion-receive port = 4711</b>
[state-assertion] Waiting for connection...</pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Then start the "producer" Simics instance and connect to the waiting 
    consumer instance:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics1&gt; <b>load-module state-assertion</b>
simics1&gt; <b>state-assertion-connect port = 4711</b>
[state-assertion] File created successfully.
sa0 connected. You probably want to add some objects or memory space now with 
'add' and 'add-mem-lis', then run 'start' to begin the assertion process.</pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    The receiving Simics should acknowledge the connection. Start the asserting:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics2&gt; <b>sa0.start</b></pre><p>
    Notice that the prompt will not return until after the first number
    of <i>steps</i> are executed in the producing Simics instance.
  </p></li>

  <li>
    In analogy to the previous example, add one or more objects to the 
    setup in the producing Simics instance and start the assertion:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics1&gt; <b>sa0.add obj = "board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]" steps = 1000000</b>
[state-assertion] Added board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0] (x86QSP1) with save type 1<img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
(every 1000000 steps) - version 0.0
simics1&gt; <b>sa0.start</b>
simics1&gt; <b>c</b></pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Soon the receiving Simics instance gets back its prompt, start that 
    simulation and the receiver will now simulate the same target as the 
    producer and compare its state every interval with the state given by 
    the producer.
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics2&gt; <b>c</b></pre><p>
  </p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Even though errors found while using <b>state-assertion</b>
may seem trivial or non-important, it is always better to address them
as soon as possible. Should you later have to contact Simics Support, it
may be necessary to provide a useful checkpoint to enable the support
engineers to reproduce the issue.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Debugging-DML-Models-in-Simics">3 Debugging DML Models in Simics</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This chapter describes how to debug errors in DML models in Simics
Environment.<br>
</p><p>
The programming language DML is designed to make it easy to develop
device models. The DML compiler, called <code>dmlc</code>, translates
code written in DML into C source code. However, users who want to
debug device models written in DML do not need to look into the details
of the generated C code as it is possible to directly debug the DML code.
Debugging devices written in DML is very similar to debugging C code.<br>
</p><p>
In this document the GDB shipped with the <code>Simics GDB (#1031)</code>
package is used.
<code>GDB</code> (see <a class="jdocu" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/</a>)
is an open source, general purpose debugger that allows you to follow
the execution of a program that runs "inside" GDB, inspect variables,
and many other possibilities described in GDB's on-line manual.
Simics is compiled with a modern GCC version which contains Dwarf
version 4 debugging information. We currently extend GDB 12.1 to
include such information and DML knowledge.<br>
</p><p>
With the GDB shipped in Simics GDB (#1031) you can:
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Set line breakpoints and function breakpoints in DML code.
  </li>

  <li>
    Step directly in DML code.
  </li>

  <li>
    Evaluate DML symbols directly instead of the mangled C symbols, such as
    variables, stack frames and so on.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
A short guide for running Simics under GDB:
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Use the GDB which contains DML knowledge (from the Simics GDB (#1031) package).
    If you debug from CLI, use bin/gdb to start GDB.
  </li>

  <li>
    Start Simics and run the simulation close to the point in time where the
    error surfaces. Use the Simics <b>pid</b> command to obtain the current
    id of the Simics process.
  </li>

  <li>
    Use GDB to attach to the Simics process.
  </li>

  <li>
    Try to set valid breakpoints for functions or lines in your code.
  </li>

  <li>
    Control and debug the continued execution of Simics with GDB.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
In the following sections, we will show you how to debug Simics models
(written in DML), both from Simics CLI and Simics Eclipse.
</p><p>
More information on how to build the modules can be found in the <em>Model
Builder User's Guide</em> (the chapter on Build Environment), and
the <em>DML 1.2 Reference Manual</em> (the chapter on Running DMLC).
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Debug-Device-from-CLI">3.1 Debug Device from CLI</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h4 class="jdocu"><a name="Prepare-the-Example">3.1.1 Prepare the Example</a></h4>
<p>

</p><p>
This section prepares a simple synthetic example that will cause a segmentation
fault and as a result will crash Simics. In the following session, we
will use the example to show a debugging process.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Setup project and prepare the device source code<br>
    Create a project and copy a DML device as follows:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      joe@computer:~$ <b>&lt;simics-installation&gt;/bin/project-setup proj</b>
      joe@computer:~: <b>cd proj</b>
      joe@computer:~/proj: <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=simple-broken-device-gdb</b>
    </pre><p>
    This copies a sample device to the folder <code>modules/simple-broken-device-gdb/</code>.
    The device is defined by the <code>simple-broken-device-gdb.dml</code> file:
    
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">
method two(int *val) {
    local int bar = *val;
    log info: "method \"two\" called %d", bar;
}

method one() {
    local int *foo = NULL;
    log info: "method \"one\" called";
    two(foo);
}

attribute int_attr is int64_attr "An integer attribute" {
    method set(attr_value_t val) throws {
        default(val);
        after_set();
    }
    method after_set() throws {
        log info: "attribute int_attr updated";
        one();
    }
}

bank regs {
    register reg size 4 @ 1000 {
        param init_val = 54;
        method set(uint64 val) {
            default(val);
        }
    }
    register reg_array[i &lt; 4] size 4 @ 2000 + i * 4 {
        param init_val = 78 + i;
    }
    group reg_group[i &lt; 4] {
        register reg_array[j &lt; 4] size 4 @ 3000 + i * 20 + j * 4 {
            param init_val = 78 + i * 10 + j;
        }
    }
}

</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
    Notice how function "one" will call function "two" with a <code>NULL</code>
    pointer, which will definitely cause a crash at the line
    <code>local int bar = *val</code>.
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Build the device<br>
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      joe@computer:~/proj: <b>make</b>
      === Building module "simple-broken-device-gdb" ===
      ...
    </pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Start Simics, use the device and trigger the error<br>
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      joe@computer:~/proj: <b>./simics</b>
      
      simics&gt; <b>load-module simple-broken-device-gdb</b>

      ...
    </pre><p>
  </p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The error caused a SIGSEGV and the stack trace points to our own module
as the current frame. With tools such as <code>nm</code> and <code>objdump</code>
it may be possible to pin-point the line in the source code, but with
GDB we may monitor the execution and find a suspect.

</p><h4 class="jdocu"><a name="Example-Session">3.1.2 Example Session</a></h4>
<p>

</p><p>
In this session, we will show the detailed debugging process. Note that
the project makefile compiles optimized modules by default, hence we need
to recompile the module with the proper compilation options for a better
debugging experience. The GDB shipped with Simics has been extended with
DML knowledge. Use <code>bin/gdb</code> to run it.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>
    Setup project and prepare the device source code<br>
    This is done in the prior session 'Prepare for the Example'.
<p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Re-build the device without optimization and with debug artifacts:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      joe@computer:~/proj: <b>make clean</b>

  </p></li>

  <li>
    Start Simics, create object, list PID
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      joe@computer:~/proj: <b>./simics</b>

    <pre class="jdocu_small">      joe@computer:~/proj: <b>./bin/gdb --pid 12345</b>
    </pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Set a breakpoint
<p>
    Function names can be referenced the same way as in DML:

    </div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
It's possible for a DML symbol to have the same name as a C symbol
      within GDB; in such ambiguous cases, the C symbol is prioritized.
      The DML symbol can be explicitly chosen by disambiguating through the use
      of <code>dev.</code><em>symbol</em><code></code> or <code>this.</code><em>symbol</em><code></code>,
      depending on the context.
    </div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
A known issue with GDB is that it's not possible to break on methods
      with a <code>shared</code> implementation (defined in a template).
      This means that you are not able to, for example, break on the default
      implementations of <code>get</code> or <code>set</code> of registers.
<p>
      A work-around for this is to provide a non-<code>shared</code> implementation
      of the method you wish to break on in the source file, by simply
      overriding that method and calling the default implementation:
      </p><pre class="jdocu_small">register reg size 4 @ 1000 {
    param init_val = 54;
    method set(uint64 val) {
        default(val);
    }
}
      </pre><p>
      As the overriding method implementation is not <code>shared</code>, it is
      possible to break on it.
    </p></div></li>

  <li>
    Continue running the process:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">    (gdb) <b>c</b>
    Continuing.
    </pre><p>
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Trigger the breakpoint<br>
    Set the variable <code>trbl-&gt;int_attr</code> at CLI:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      simics&gt; <b>trbl-&gt;int_attr = 4711</b>

This is a trivial example and ends here. Next steps for a normal debug session
would be to figure out why <code>foo</code> was assigned a <code>NULL</code> value.

</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Valgrind is only available on Linux hosts.</div>This chapter describes how to use Valgrind to debug errors in Simics models,
including memory corruptions, which can be difficult to find. For these type of
bugs Valgrind is a very powerful tool, despite the reduced execution speed
caused by Valgrind's instrumentation and execution model.
<p>

<code>Valgrind</code> (see <a class="jdocu" href="http://valgrind.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">http://valgrind.org</a>) is an open-source 
tool for memory debugging, memory leak detection, and profiling Linux programs.
</p><p>
A short guide for running Simics under Valgrind:
</p><ol>
<li>Install Valgrind on your host.</li>
<li>Compile the <code>valgrind-support</code> Simics module.</li>
<li>Instead of running <code>./simics</code> run 
    <code>./bin/valgrind-simics</code>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="installing-valgrind">4.1 Installing Valgrind</a></h3>
<p>

If you downloaded the tarball from <a class="jdocu" href="http://valgrind.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">http://valgrind.org</a>, run the
customary </p><pre class="jdocu_small">./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</pre><p>
</p><p>
If you have installed the pre-built package that comes with your linux
distribution, make sure you also install the development package as you will
need it when compiling the Simics valgrind-support module.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="compiling-valgrind-support">4.2 Compiling valgrind-support</a></h3>
<p>

As Valgrind instruments the code that executes under its supervision,
we need to restrict Valgrind to not instrument the JIT code generated by Simics 
(the JIT code produced by Simics does not tolerate being changed).
This can be achieved by loading the <code>valgrind-support</code> module into
Simics. The binary interface for telling Valgrind that it should ignore certain
regions of memory changes between different versions of Valgrind. This is
why you should compile your own version of <code>valgrind-support</code> for the
Valgrind-version which you are using.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project$ <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=valgrind-support</b>
project$ <b>make valgrind-support</b>
</pre><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
This step requires that you have access to the <code>valgrind.h</code>
header that comes with the valgrind tarball or the valgrind development
package</div>
<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="running-valgrind">4.3 Running Valgrind on Simics</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
To start Simics under Valgrind you should use the 
<code>./bin/valgrind-simics</code> script.
This script sets up the needed environment similar to 
<code>./simics</code> but
instead starts Valgrind wrapping the Simics binary.
</p><p>
The script automatically passes the following arguments to Valgrind:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  --tool=memcheck
  --suppressions=$HOSTSDIR/scripts/simics-valgrind.supp
  --soname-synonyms=somalloc=NONE
</pre><p>
</p><p>
These options tell Valgrind to use the <code>memcheck</code> tool for detecting
memory errors, to suppress false positives in Simics use of embedded python and to handle ovarloaded new/delete in C++ code.
</p><p>
Run Simics with Valgrind loading a target script:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project$ <b>bin/valgrind-simics targets/ebony/ebony-linux-firststeps.simics</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To override the default arguments to Valgrind, it is possible to set the
<code>VALGRIND_OPTIONS</code> environment variable before starting
<code>valgrind-simics</code>.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  project$ <b>env VALGRIND_OPTIONS="--num-callers=20 <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
 --suppressions=&lt;simics-installation&gt;/scripts/simics-valgrind.supp <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
 --tool=memcheck" bin/valgrind-simics</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
When setting custom VALGRIND_OPTIONS the default options must also be passed.</div>

Simics comes with an example device with multiple errors in it. The device can
be used to get acquainted with Valgrind. Copy it to your project with the
following command:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  project&gt; <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=simple-broken-device-valgrind</b>

        }
    }

    // Accessing released memory
    register r @ 0x0200 {

            log info: "read from r";
            local char *s = new char[10];
            strcpy(s, "foo");

    }
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Here is a session using this device. Some of the output from Valgrind has
been omitted from the example to focus on the important information.
</p><p>
Start with a minimal system containing just our broken device and a
memory-space. Map the device into the memory space and try to access it.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>@SIM_create_object("memory-space", "phys_mem")</b>
&lt;the memory-space 'phys_mem'&gt;
simics&gt; <b>@SIM_create_object("simple_broken_device_valgrind", "broken")</b>
&lt;the simple_broken_device_valgrind 'broken'&gt;
simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.add-map broken 0x0 0x300</b>
Mapped 'broken' in 'phys_mem' at address 0x0.
simics&gt; <b>phys_mem.read     0 size = 1 # Should be okay</b>
[broken info] read from u[0]

[broken info] read from u[49]
0x0000
</pre><p>
</p><p>
We can see that access to the <code>u[0]</code> and <code>u[49]</code>
registers are OK. No complaints from Valgrind.
</p><p>
Now let's try to access outside of malloc'd region:

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Simics-built-in-memory-tracking">5 Simics built-in memory tracking</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics contains a very simple system for tracking heap allocations
made from C and DML. It is provided "as-is" and may disappear or
change without prior notice, as it depends on internal implementation
aspects.
</p><p>
Allocations are only tracked when made using one of the macros in the
<code>MM_MALLOC</code> family. Some calls to <b><i>malloc</i></b> may also be
tracked if they were made in code including the header
<code>simics/util/alloc.h</code>, but this should not be relied upon.
</p><p>
Any allocation made by other means will not be visible in this system.
In particular, this includes anything allocated by Python. Some of the
internal allocations made by the simulator itself may also be hidden
from view.
</p><p>
The memory tracking makes Simics run more slowly and use more memory,
so it has to be enabled explicitly by setting the environment variable
<code>SIMICS_MEMORY_TRACKING</code> to 1 before starting the simulator.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Memory-tracking-commands">5.1 Memory tracking commands</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The <b>mm-list-types</b>, <b>mm-list-sites</b> and

</p><p>

on the Simics command line. The commands all have an optional parameter to limit

in the way their output is aggregated and sorted. The columns in the response
are:
