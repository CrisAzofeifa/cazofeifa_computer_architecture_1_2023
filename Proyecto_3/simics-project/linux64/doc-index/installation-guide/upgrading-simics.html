<p>

</p><p>
Simics 6 is not directly compatible with Simics 4.8,
since the add-on packages for those versions will not work with Simics
6 and vice versa. However, Simics 6
supports the same kind of installation and multi-user configuration,
so upgrading should be very simple.
</p><p>
Simics 6 is API but not ABI compatible with Simics 4.8.
This means that user-written modules in projects for those versions
have to be recompiled before they can be used with Simics
6. When recompiling, the 4.8 API has to be
selected to get access to deprecated parts of the API. This is
described in the <em>Simics Migration Guide</em>.
</p><p>
However, add-on packages from Simics 5 will in general work with
Simics 6.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Upgrading-of-Minor-6-Releases">4.2 Upgrading of Minor 6 Releases</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics 6 releases are binary compatible, so nothing
special needs to be done when upgrading. Unless specifically mentioned
in the <em>Release Notes</em>, add-on packages should work with
any Simics 6 installation. A more detailed description
of compatibility issues for user-created modules is available in
the <em>Simics Migration Guide</em>.
