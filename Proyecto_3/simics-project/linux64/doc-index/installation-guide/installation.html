<p>

</p><p>
This section describes the deprecated way to install Simics, for users
who are not yet using the Intel Simics Package Manager.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Linux">3.1 Linux</a></h2>
<p>


Simics is delivered in <em>packages</em>, each one containing different parts
of the functionality. There is a base package and several add-on packages.
The packages can be combined to create a
customized installation. The most common packages are:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

  <li>The <em>Simics Base</em> package contains <em>Simics</em>
  — the Simics execution engine and the user interface, as well
  as a library of standard models.
  </li>

  <li>The <em>Simics Express</em> package contains <em>Simics Express</em>
  — a Simics execution engine and a library of standard models but with
  limited user interface and just a sub-set of features. Some sections of this
  guide do not apply to <em>Simics Express</em>.
  </li>

  <li>An add-on package for each virtual platform, usually containing
  a CPU core and various devices. The virtual platform is the
  simulation platform and the model of the physical target hardware
  that is being simulated.
  </li>

  <li>The <em>Quick-Start Platform for x86</em> (QSP-x86) add-on package is
  meant for training, application development, demos, etc.
  </li>

</ul>
<p>


</p><p>
The installation process is described in the following
chapters. This is a quick overview of the steps involved.
</p><ol>

<li>Download the base package and the add-on packages you will use.</li>

<li>Install the packages, using the corresponding
decryption key.</li>

<li>Create a project, to store the files you are working on.</li>

</ol>
<p>
Add-on packages are <em>not</em> installed on top of the main Simics
installation. Instead each package stays in its own directory, and Simics is
simply instructed to look for add-on packages in various places using the
<code>addon-manager</code> program
</p><p>
When installing Simics in a shared environment, several options are provided
for multi-user installations. Refer to chapter 
<a class="reference" href="advanced-installation.html">5</a> for a complete description.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The packages are encrypted, and the decryption keys are
provided to Wind River customers separately.</div>
<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="unix-first-time">3.1.1 First Installation</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
As a Simics customer, you should have received instructions that
describes which packages you should download and where to find
them. If this is not the case, contact your Simics provider to obtain this
information.
</p><p>
</p><ol>

<li>Start by downloading the packages you want to install. We will use
package 1000 (<em>Simics Base</em> package) and package 2096
(<em>QSP-x86</em> model library) as an example.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>cd simics-download</b>

simics-pkg-1000-6.0.0-linux64.tar
simics-pkg-2096-6.0.0-linux64.tar
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The packages are <code>.tar</code> files that can be unpacked with the
<code>tar</code> command. Unpacking the packages will create a
<code>simics-6-install</code> directory with the relevant
installation files:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>tar xf simics-pkg-1000-6.0.0-linux64.tar</b>

</pre><p>
</p><p>
The file <code>installation-guide.pdf</code> is a copy of this
manual. The <code>tar.gz.aes</code> files contains the compressed and
encrypted package contents to be installed. The installation script
<code>install-simics.pl</code> is used in the next step of the
installation.
</p><p>
</p></li>

<li>Run the installation script:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>cd simics-6-install</b>
joe@computer$ <b>./install-simics.pl</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The script must be run from the installation directory.</div></li>

<li>The script will present a list of packages to install. Simply
type the number listed in front of each package you wish to
install. In the example we install all packages (<em>Simics Base</em> and
<em>QSP-x86</em>):
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">install-simics can install the following packages:

packages in the same directory
e.g. <code>/opt/simics/simics-6</code>.
</p><p>
The installer will propose a default configuration that should always
work with the latest installed version of Simics. For customized
configurations, please read the <i>Add-on

</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Uninstalling-Simics">3.1.6 Uninstalling Simics</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Uninstalling Simics is very simple, just remove the directories
that were created for each package during the installation. Note the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>If you delete an add-on package that is still referenced in the add-on
packages list of a Simics installation, the add-on package will simply be
considered invalid and ignored. The <code>project-setup</code> program will
however suggest that you update projects that were using that add-on
package.</li>

<li>If you delete a Simics installation, you will need to reconfigure the
projects that depended on it by running the <code>project-setup</code>
program from another Simics installation.</li>

</ul>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Installing-VMP">3.1.7 Installing VMP</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
VMP uses direct execution to simulate x86 systems at near native
speed. Kernel modules are needed to communicate directly with the host
hardware, and installing those kernel modules requires a separate
step.
</p><p>


</p><p>
Installing and managing VMP kernel modules requires sudo
privileges. Installing will compile the kernel module and therefore
also requires an environment to build kernel modules. Which packages
you need for building kernel modules depend on the distribution of
Linux that you are using, but at least for certain Red Hat based
distributions you would
need <code>gcc-c++</code>, <code>kernel-headers</code>,
and <code>kernel-devel</code>. Change directory to the Simics Base package
and run:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>bin/vmp-kernel-install</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The script will compile and persistently install the kernel modules
that are used by VMP. It will echo what needs to be done, which
involves running scripts in the <code>vmxmon/scripts/</code>
directory.
</p><p>
Disable VMP temporarily by running
the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-unload</code> script, and enable VMP with
the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-load</code> script. Permanently uninstall VMP
from your host by running the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-uninstall</code>
script.
</p><p>
If your installation is read-only, or you for some other reason want
to have the built VMP artifacts outside of the installation, you can
give a directory to the relevant VMP scripts, example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>bin/vmp-kernel-install /somewhere/directory</b>
joe@computer$ <b>bin/vmp-kernel-load /somewhere/directory</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
See the <em>VMP</em> section in the <em>Simulation Performance</em>
chapter of the <em>Simics User's Guide</em> for information about
enabling and using VMP.

<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Start-Simics2">3.2.2 Start Simics</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
To get started, run the <i>Simics Classic UI</i> and set up a project.
</p><p>
If you are new to Simics, you will find more information if you open
the <em>Getting Started</em> document and follow the tutorial. You
will find it under the Start Menu in your Simics installation or in
the Simics on-line help.
</p><p>


</p><ul>
<li>Start <i>Simics Classic UI</i> from the Start Menu.</li>

  <li>You will be asked to select an empty directory where Simics
    can create a project. The project is used to create and edit
    scripts and keep the files you are working on, without touching
    any files of the installed packages.<br> Choose a project name
    and click <b>OK</b>.</li>

<li>Click <b>Yes</b> when asked to create a new project
directory. </li>

<li>The installation is now finished and Simics will start.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The installer depends on the Windows program <b>msiexec.exe</b> which is
  limited to running one installation at a time, and not several in parallel.

<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Reinstall-Simics-Base2">3.2.3 Reinstall Simics Base</a></h3>
<p>

 If this is not the first time you install Simics Base you are
   provided with the option to copy the configuration of an earlier
   Simics installation.
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="install-more2">3.2.4 Installing More Packages</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
You can install more packages at any time using the same steps as in
chapter <a class="reference" href="#unix-first-time">3.1.1</a>.  It is easiest to install all
packages in the same directory
e.g. <code>/opt/simics/simics-6</code>.
</p><p>
The installer will propose a default configuration that should always
work with the latest installed version of Simics. For customized
configurations, please read the <i>Add-on
Manager</i>, chapter <a class="reference" href="advanced-installation.html">5</a>.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Uninstalling-Simics2">3.2.5 Uninstalling Simics</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
To uninstall Simics or its add-on packages, navigate to <b>Start
Menu → Control Panel → Programs and Features</b>, select
and right-click an entry and select <i>Uninstall</i>. Another option is to run
the downloaded installation <code>.exe</code> file and eventually
select <i>Remove</i>.
</p><p>
Note the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>If you delete an add-on package that is still referenced in the add-on
packages list of a Simics installation, the add-on package will simply be
considered invalid and ignored. The <code>project-setup</code> program will
however suggest that you update projects that were using that add-on
package.</li>

<li>If you delete a Simics installation, you will need to reconfigure the
projects that depended on it by running the <code>project-setup</code>
program from another Simics installation.</li>

</ul>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Installing-VMP2">3.2.6 Installing VMP</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
VMP uses direct execution to simulate x86 systems at near native
speed. Kernel modules are needed to communicate directly with the host
hardware, and installing those kernel modules requires a separate
step.
</p><p>


</p><p>
The kernel module can be loaded and unloaded by running
the <code>bin\vmp-kernel-load.bat</code>
respective <code>bin\vmp-kernel-unload.bat</code> scripts as
administrator. To do that, open a command shell as administrator and run:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>bin\vmp-kernel-load.bat</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Another way to perform the same action would be to right-click on
<code>vmp-kernel-load.bat</code> and select run as administrator.
</p><p>
The /AUTO and /DEMAND options select the start option for the VMP
service. With /AUTO (default), the service will be available after
restart whereas with /DEMAND (which used to be the behavior before
these flags were added) will mean that the service is only available
until shutdown or reboot and then has to be manually loaded again if
needed.
</p><p>
If the script fails, see the Windows event log for more
information. The most common reason is that Intel® VT-x technology or the NX
feature is not enabled in the BIOS. The kernel module will also fail
to load if Windows is running with the Hyper-V feature enabled.

</p><p>
See the <em>VMP</em> section in the <em>Simulation Performance</em>
chapter of the <em>Simics User's Guide</em> for information about
enabling and using VMP.
