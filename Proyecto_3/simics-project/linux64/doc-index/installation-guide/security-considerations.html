Simics runs as a user application with standard privileges and is
secure at its core. However, it has some features that present potential
vulnerabilities which are good to be aware of before enabling
them. None of them are enabled by default.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Access to the Simics command line provides access to arbitrary
    shell commands on the simulation host (as the user running
    Simics). Hence usage of <b>telnet-frontend</b> potentially opens
    up shell access to the simulation host to anyone with network access to it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Similarly, access to the simulated target system may potentially be used to
    obtain access to the host (as the user running Simics). The
    features which provide communication between target and Simics,
    and which therefore could introduce this type of risk,
    are <b>SimicsFS</b>, <b>Simics Agent</b>, the host serial
    connections in the <b>host-serial-console</b> and <b>textcon</b>
    modules, and the debugging functionality in <b>tcf-agent</b>.
    In general, bugs in Simics devices can lead
    to crashes or similar that results in access to the simulation host.
  </li>
  <li>
    Some features may provide access to the simulated target system to
    users who have network access to the simulation host. By the
    previous point, this may be exploited to access the simulation
    host. These features are the VNC server in the <b>graphcon</b>
    module, the telnet servers in the <b>telnet-console</b>
    and <b>textcon</b> modules, the <b>gdb-remote</b> module,
    distributed simulation and all types of real network connections
    using the <b>real-network</b> module.
  </li>
  <li>
    The connection modules mentioned above can be configured to use
    restrictive connection types, domain sockets on Linux and named
    pipes on Windows, that do not make the simulation host accessible
    over the network.
  </li>
  <li>
    Real network connections in particular should be used with care,
    as they also allow the target system to initiate connections to
    the network that the simulation host is connected to. This can
    potentially expose information about the target. Moreover,
    the <b>Ethernet bridging</b> type of real network connection makes
    it possible for Simics users as well as software at the simulated
    target machine to access raw Ethernet frames on the local network
    of the host. In particular, do not use the Simics network services
    (the <b>service-node</b>) when bridging networks, as this exposes
    those services to the host network, which is both a security
    concern and can also lead to conflicts with other similar services
    on the network. Also, Ethernet bridging uses TAP which requires
    administrator privileges to setup, an additional risk.
  </li>
  <li>
    It is recommended to only use any of the features mentioned above
    when the simulation host is on a secure network.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>VMP</b> is a kernel module that must be installed with
    administrator privileges and that runs in supervisor mode. Hence,
    bugs in Simics processor models can potentially crash the host
    when running in VMP mode.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Simics packages often include software intended to run in the
simulated target systems. This software is supplied for demonstration
and training purposes only and is not intended to be used as part of
production setups.
