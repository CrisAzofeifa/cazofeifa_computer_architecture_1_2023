All Simics packages are installed separately, in
different directories. This makes it easy to upgrade or remove a
package without touching the rest of the installation. Each Simics
installation keeps its own list of paths to add-on packages, called
the add-on package list. It makes them available to the Simics engine
at run-time. This list can be printed and configured using
the <code>addon-manager</code> program.
</p><p>
Here are a few examples of what the <code>addon-manager</code> can do:

</p><p>


</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Add-on-Packages-Module-Lookup">5.2 Add-on Packages: Module Lookup</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics automatically recognizes modules that are located in the current
project, in any of the configured add-on packages, and in the base
installation. When confronted with several versions of the same modules, it
applies the following selection rules:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:user-modules"><b>User Modules</b></dt><dd>This includes the modules compiled in the current
project as well as the modules found in paths specified by the <i>-L</i>
command-line option, the <code>SIMICS_EXTRA_LIB</code> environment variable, or
the <b>add-module-directory</b> command.</dd><dt id="dt:packaged-modules"><b>Packaged Modules</b></dt><dd>This include all modules provided by
Simics itself or its add-on packages.</dd></dl><p>When the same module is found in several locations, user modules are always
chosen in preference to packaged modules: if you recompile a module provided as
source code in your project, the project version will always be chosen
first, as long as it is possible to load it into Simics.
</p><p>
Within the same group of modules, priority is given to the newest module,
according to the build date that is compiled in the module at link time. For
example, when two add-on packages provide the same module, Simics will always
load the newest one.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="win-3rdparty">5.3 Third-Party Products and Other Add-ons</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Some functionality in Simics requires third-party products. These are:
OpenVPN TAP driver, MinGW and any software that can set up virtual COM
ports.
</p><p>
Simics requires the OpenVPN TAP driver to access a real network using
bridges or host connections. The port-forwarding kind of real network
connection, included in Simics, does not require any third
party software. To learn more about the different real network
connection types available, read the <em>Ethernet Networking</em>
technology guide.
</p><p>
If you plan to create new models in Simics, you will need the MinGW tools to
compile your models.
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:openvpn-tap-installation"><b>OpenVPN TAP Installation</b></dt><dd>The OpenVPN TAP driver must be installed separately from Simics.

  </dd><dt id="dt:mingw-installation"><b>MinGW Installation</b></dt><dd>MinGW-w64 provides the GCC compiler and the make program that is needed to

<p>
    The <code>project-setup</code> script will search in <code>C:\</code> and
    in the parent folder of the Simics Base installation for a directory
    named <code>mingw64</code>, which must contain the prebuilt MinGW. However,

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Multi-user-Installations">5.4 Multi-user Installations</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Shared-Installations">5.4.1 Shared Installations</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
By default, Simics is organized so that the installed packages can be left
read-only; users work in a project, as described in our manuals, or in an
appropriate work area. This makes it easy to share a Simics installation since
the packages can be simply installed in a common location accessible to all
users. In this case, all of them will share the same combination of
add-on packages, essentially the exact same Simics installation.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Per-user-Configuration">5.4.2 Per-user Configuration</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics can be installed so that add-on package configuration is done
on a per-user basis. Each user will configure the specific add-on
packages it wishes to use. This configuration can be stored in a
project (the easiest alternative) or in a separate file. Per-user
configuration lets you install Simics in a read-only location while
giving users full freedom to configure and run with the add-on
packages of their choice.
</p><p>
By default a project inherits the package associations of the main
installation: When a package is installed in the main installation,
this affects Simics when invoked from the project. When per-user
configuration is used, a project instead manages add-on packages
independently of the main installation, via
the <code>addon-manager</code> script located in the project. The
project will not be affected by the package associations of the main
installation.  In order to enable per-user configuration in a
project, run the <code>addon-manager</code> script located in that
project, with the <i>-c</i> or <i>-C</i> option.
With <i>-c</i>, the initial project-local configuration will
have no package associations; with <i>-C</i>, it will be based on
the set of packages currently configured in the main installation.
Local configuration is done with further invocations of
the <code>addon-manager</code> script in the project.
</p><p>
The add-on package configuration can also be stored in a specific file, by
using the <i>-f</i> option of the <code>addon-manager</code>
script. Configuration is identical to the other cases, but Simics must be
informed explicitly of the existence of the file via its own command line
argument <i>-package-file</i>.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Installation-under-Configuration-Management-Systems">5.4.3 Installation under Configuration Management Systems</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
If the Simics packages are imported in a configuration management system such as
ClearCase or CVS, different options are available:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>If each user can check-out and modify its own copy of the package
installation, they can choose to use a common configuration or to
create their own customized one. Use relative paths in the add-on
configuration in order to let users customize the location of the
Simics installation.</li>

<li>If the installation must be kept read-only, configurations can be performed
either globally, when importing the Simics packages, or on a per-user basis, as
described in the previous section.</li>

</ul>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Multi-user-Installation-on-Windows">5.4.4 Multi-user Installation on Windows</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Currently, Simics packages are meant to be installed per machine. User
installation is not supported. Simics packages can be installed side by side
without risks, as each release of a given package is independent from all
others.
</p><p>
Packages are installed read-only, and all the instructions above can be
followed to create global or per-user configurations.

</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Installer-Options">5.5 Installer Options</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The Simics installer script provides command line options to directly specify
the packages to install and the way it should be done. When command line
options are provided, the corresponding questions in the interactive
installation are skipped automatically.
</p><p>
It is possible to run the installer in batch mode, by passing the
<i>-b</i> switch.
</p><p>
The installation script creates a log file called <code>install.log</code> in
the current directory. If something goes wrong during the installation,
the log file can be used to examine the situation.
</p><p>
See <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for the full list of command line
arguments for <code>install-simics.pl</code>.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Add-on-Manager-Options">5.6 Add-on Manager Options</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The Simics Add-on Manager is provided with your Simics
installation. You will find it at
<code></code><em>[simics]</em><code>/bin/addon-manager</code>, or at
<code></code><em>[project]</em><code>/bin/addon-manager</code>. The addon-manager script
found in the project will associate packages with the project,
while the script in the base package will associate packages with the
main Simics installation.
</p><p>
By default, a project inherits the package associations of the main
installation. If you want to make package associations locally in a project,
you must first run addon-manager once with the <i>-C</i> or <i>-c</i>
switch, in order to override this default.
</p><p>
In all cases, the <code>addon-manager</code> script creates a log file called
<code>addon-manager.log</code> in the current directory. This log file can, if
necessary, be used to debug and understand any errors that occurred.
</p><p>
It is possible to run the addon-manager in batch mode, by passing
the <i>-b</i> switch.
</p><p>
See <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for the full list of command line
arguments that can be given to <code>addon-manager</code>.
