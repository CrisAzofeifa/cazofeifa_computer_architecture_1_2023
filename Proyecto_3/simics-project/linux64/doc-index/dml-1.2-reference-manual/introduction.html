<p>The DML tool provides a programming language for modeling devices
in Simics. DML has been designed to make it easy to represent the
kind of things that are needed by a device model, and uses special syntactic
constructs to describe common elements such as memory mapped hardware registers
and connections to other Simics configuration objects.</p>
<p>The DML compiler is called <code>dmlc</code>. It translates a device model
description written in DML into C source code that can be compiled and
loaded as a Simics module.</p>
<p>This document describes the DML language, the standard libraries, and
the <code>dmlc</code> compiler, as of version 1.2 of DML. See
also <em>Simics Model Builder User's Guide</em> for an introduction
to DML.</p>
<h2 id="requirements">1.1 <a href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>The DML compiler and standard libraries, the documentation, and the
example devices, are provided by the <em>Model Builder</em> product,
which is bundled with the <em>Simics Base</em> package.</p>
<p>To run <code>dmlc</code>, and to build a device model generated from
DML, it is also necessary to have a license and a key for Simics Model Builder
and a working Simics build environment; see
<em>Simics Model Builder User's Guide</em> for details.</p>
