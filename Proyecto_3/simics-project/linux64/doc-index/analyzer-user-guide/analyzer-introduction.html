<p>Simics Analyzer provides features for completely non-intrusive analysis and debugging of software applications within Simics. It makes it possible to see what software processes are running, and to inspect, analyze and debug them individually. It includes tools for code coverage analysis and other profiling. This document describes how these features work, and shows how to use them.</p>
<p>Many of the features described in this documentation build on other features in Simics, and it is recommended that you read the <em>Simics User's Guide</em> to familiarize yourself with the Simics debugging tools.</p>
<p>Simics Analyzer includes a source code debugger for C and C++, that you can use from the Simics command line. You can read more about it in chapter <a class="reference" href="debugging-target-code.html">3</a>.</p>
