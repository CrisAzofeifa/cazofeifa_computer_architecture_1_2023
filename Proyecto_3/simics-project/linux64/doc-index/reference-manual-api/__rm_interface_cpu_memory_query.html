</p><p>

   The <b><i>logical_address</i></b> and <b><i>physical_address</i></b> methods are
   used to get the different addresses of the memory operation.
</p><p>
   Below, callbacks registered by the <b><i>register_read_before_cb</i></b> or the
   <b><i>register_write_before_cb</i></b> in the
   <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface or in the
   <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface are referred to as being
   in <i>before</i> context. Callbacks registered by the
   <b><i>register_read_after_cb</i></b> or the <b><i>register_write_after_cb</i></b>
   in the <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface or in the
   <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface are referred to as being
   in <i>after</i> context.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>set_host_ptr</i></b> method can be used to redirect where data should
   be read from or written to depending on if it is a read or a write
   operation.  The method is only useful for callbacks registered in
   <i>before</i> context. The data pointer <i>p</i> needs to be valid
   during the execution of the instruction and must point to enough space to
   carry out the operation. This method is not available in Python.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_bytes</i></b> method is used to retrieve the bytes that is going
   to be read/written if called in a <i>before</i> context and is used to read
   out value that was read/written in <i>after</i> context. The value is
   returned as <code>cpu_bytes_t</code>:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef struct cpu_bytes {
        size_t size;
#ifndef PYWRAP
        const uint8 *data;
#endif
} cpu_bytes_t;</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The member <code>data</code> contains the data pointer, and the member
   <code>size</code> contains tha size of the data. It is illegal to access beyond
   the limit. For such access, see the <b><i>get_surrounding_bytes</i></b> below.
</p><p>
   The read value in <i>before</i> context may not be
   available (a device access for example) and in this case the data member
   will be NULL.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>set_bytes</i></b> method is used to override the bytes to be read or
   written. The method is only valid in the <i>before</i> context. This method
   can be used instead of the <b><i>set_host_ptr</i></b> to change the value of
   the operation. The value is passed as <code>cpu_bytes_t</code> and the
   supplied data in the data member need not to be valid after the callback
   returns since the data is copied. The length of the data cannot be changes
   and must be the same as returned by the <b><i>get_bytes</i></b> method.
        </p><p>
   The <b><i>atomic</i></b> method returned true if the operation is considered
   atomic, false otherwise.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>arch</i></b> method returns the <code>ini_type_t</code> of the memory
   operation.
</p><p>
   Accesses that cross a page boundary are split into two subsequent accesses,
   one for the first page and one for the second page. The
   <b><i>get_page_crossing_info</i></b> method can be used to distinguish the
   different cases from each other. The returned value from the method is of
   type <code>page_crossing_info_t</code> and can be one of:
   <code>Sim_Page_Crossing_None</code> (no crossing access),
   <code>Sim_Page_Crossing_First</code> (first part of a crossing access), or
   <code>Sim_Page_Crossing_Second</code> (second part of a crossing access).
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_surrounding_bytes</i></b> method provides quick access to the
   data surrounding the access. The <i>granularity_log2</i> specifies the
   size and alignment of the buffer being returned. For example using 6 for
   <i>granularity_log2</i>, will fetch 64 aligned bytes around the
   address of the access. Typically, the largest supported granularity_log2
   size is 12, meaning a 4 KiB page. The returned value is of type buffer_t and
   is only valid in the <code>cpu_memory_cb_t</code> callback. The
   data can be accessed by using the <code>buffer_t.data</code> member in the
   returned value. Data can only be read up to the size of the buffer, which is
   stored in the <code>buffer_t.len</code> member. Valid memory is only returned if
   the access terminates in simulator cached memory.  If not, the 
   <code>buffer_t.len</code> will be is 0, <code>buffer_t.data</code> cannot be used.
</p><p>
   Additional information can be read out with an architectural specific
   query interface, see <code>x86_memory_query</code> interface for details.
