<p>
   This interface is used to get notifications from events in the
   debugger. Examples of events are when certain functions, addresses or code
   lines are hit.
</p><p>
   In order to be able to get notifications for symbols, the symbol file
   containing the debug information must have been added using the
   <code>debug_setup</code> interface or in some other way.
</p><p>
   All notifications take callback functions that are called when the debugger
   event occurs. The notifications will not stop the simulation, to do so
   <b><i>SIM_break_simulation</i></b> can be called in the callback.
</p><p>
   
</p><p>
   For all functions that return an <code>attr_value_t</code>, that return value
   will consists of a list with two elements. The first element is an error code
   of <code>debugger_error_t</code> type (see <code>debug_query</code>
   interface documentation for definition). The second element depends on the
   first. If the first element is <code>Debugger_No_Error</code>, meaning that
   the function went well, then the second element will contain the expected
   return value that is specified per function below. If the first element is
   another error code, then the second element will be a string describing the
   error that occurred.

   <b><i>notify_context_creation</i></b> provides a callback when a new context
   that matches the context query <i>query</i> is created or renamed. The
   callback will also be triggered when a context is renamed, so if the context
   query matches both the name before and after the context was renamed then
   there will be two creation callbacks for the same context. When the callback
   is triggered because of a rename the <i>updated</i> argument of the
   callback will be true, otherwise if it is triggered because a new context
   was created the <i>updated</i> argument will be false.
</p><p>
   <b><i>notify_context_destruction</i></b> provides a callback when a context
   that matches the context query <i>query</i> is destroyed.
</p><p>
   The callbacks for <b><i>notify_context_creation</i></b> and
   <b><i>notify_context_destruction</i></b> will contain an ID to the context that
   was created, updated or destroyed, <i>ctx_id</i>, the tcf_agent object
   <i>obj</i> and some custom <i>data</i>.
</p><p>
   </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The <b><i>notify_context_creation</i></b> and
   <b><i>notify_context_destruction</i></b> callbacks will only trigger for
   contexts that have state, this is most commonly the leaf nodes in an OS
   Awareness node tree.</div><b><i>notify_location</i></b> will give a callback when a memory access of type
   <i>access</i> is done at the address specified by <i>location</i>,
   for contexts matching <i>query</i>. The <i>size</i> argument is used
   to specify the width of the symbol provided by <i>location</i>. For
   execution notifications a <i>size</i> of 1 is usually used. The maximum
   value of <i>size</i> is 0x7fffffff. Notifying on location will only work
   for global symbols. For symbols that are not global, no errors will be given,
   and no callback will be triggered.
<p>
   <b><i>notify_address</i></b> will provide a callback when an <i>address</i>
   is hit with a certain <i>access</i> type for contexts matching
   <i>query</i>. The <i>size</i> argument specifies the width of the
   breakpoint for the notification, with a maximum value of 0x7fffffff.
   The notification can be set to notify on <i>physical</i> breakpoints
   instead of virtual, but for that to work a processor or memory space context
   must be covered by the <i>query</i>. For process related contexts
   <i>physical</i> should be false.
</p><p>
   <b><i>notify_line</i></b> will provide a callback when a specific
   <i>line</i> and <i>column</i> in a specific source <i>file</i>
   for a context matching <i>query</i> is executed. The <i>column</i>
   argument can be set to 0 to not care about column.
</p><p>
   The notification functions <b><i>notify_location</i></b>,
   <b><i>notify_address</i></b> and <b><i>notify_line</i></b> will all provide
   callbacks on the same format. They will pass the context ID,
   <i>ctx_id</i>, for which the access occurred. A processor,
   <i>cpu</i>, which did the access is provided. The
   <i>instruction_address</i> is the address of the instruction that
   performed the access. For execution callbacks the callback will occur before
   the instruction has run, but for read or write accesses the callback will
   occur after the instruction has run. The <i>data_address</i> will
   provide which data address was accesses, for execution accesses this is the
   same as <i>instruction_address</i> but for read or write accesses this
   is where the actual access was. And <i>size</i> specifies the actual
   size of the access that was made to trigger the notification, for execution
   this size is 1.
</p><p>
   <b><i>notify_activated</i></b> and <b><i>notify_deactivated</i></b> are used to
   notify when a context, that matches the <i>query</i>, gets activated or
   deactivated. The callback for this will include which context,
   <i>ctx_id</i>, was (de)activated and on what processor, <i>cpu</i>.
</p><p>
   For all notifications functions in this interface, on success, the returned
   value of a notification function will be a cancel ID which can be used to
   cancel the notification.
</p><p>
   If several callbacks occur on the same cycle, then the order for which the
   callbacks are called is not determined. This means that a
   <b><i>notify_activated</i></b> callback for one processor can occur before a
   <b><i>notify_deactivated</i></b> callback on the same processor.
</p><p>
   <b><i>notify_callbacks_done</i></b> will be called once all other callbacks
   that happen because of the same event are done. For example when a move to
   and a move from is done in the same step then this callback can be used to
   keep grouped notifications together that occurred at the same time. This
   will always be called after one or more callbacks have been called.
</p><p>
   <b><i>cancel</i></b> is used to cancel a notification by providing it with a
   cancel ID, <i>cid</i>, that was returned from the notification function.
   When this goes well the returned value will be nil.
</p><p>
   Errors specific to this function: </p><ul>

   <li><em>Debugger_Unknown_Id</em> - The cancel ID, <i>cid</i>, is
   unknown.</li>

   </ul>
<p>
   All callbacks except <b><i>notify_location</i></b>, <b><i>notify_address</i></b>,
   and <b><i>notify_line</i></b>, with execution access, will occur after the
   instruction triggering the callbacks has executed. For the callbacks
   specified here, when using execution access, the callback will occur before
   the instruction at that location, address or line has executed.
</p><p>
   </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
In order to get contexts for processes, OS Awareness with a properly
   configured tracker has to exist. A context will then be created for each OS
   Awareness node. Without any OS Awareness tracker enabled for the system,
   contexts will only be available for processors and some memory spaces. The
   <b><i>notify_activated</i></b> and <b><i>notify_deactivated</i></b> functions will
   only give callbacks when a tracker is used, because processor contexts are
   always active. More information about configuring and using OS Awareness and
   trackers can be found in the <em>Analyzer User's Guide</em></div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
For functions that take <i>query</i> as argument, having this set
   to nil will work the same way as for <code>"*"</code>. A bad context query will
   result in a <code>Debugger_Incorrect_Context_Query</code> error.</div><pre class="jdocu_small">
