<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">Interface that the hypersim pattern handlers should provide
<p>
   <b><i>examine_pattern</i></b>:
   </p><p>
   This is an optional function which is called when a pattern has been
   detected. The function allows the hypersim object to do additional checks on
   the pattern, for instance check patterns in subroutines which are called.
   </p><p>
   The hypersim object should return non-NULL if the pattern is considered okay
   and it wants to get a callback on when it is reached. If there are problems
   with this pattern and NULL is returned the matched pattern is removed. If
   the hypersim object refuses the pattern at this location, it might be
   detected later again, since there is no 'black-list' support.
   </p><p>
   The returned value should point to a per-loop structure, that will be passed
   along in the pattern_triggered() call. Patterns that does not allocate
   per-loop structures, should return the first argument, the pointer to the
   object itself.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>pattern_triggered()</i></b> function is called when the first
   instruction in an installed pattern is reached. The cpu and the physical
   address which reached the pattern is supplied. This is the function where
   the hypersim class can do its work, such as fast-forward time.
   </p><p>
   If the hypersim object notices that it does not want to be called for this
   address here (preconditions will never be met for instance) it can return
   false. This will remove the match, but it does not prevent the
   pattern-matcher from trying again later. Returning true will cause the
   pattern_triggered() function to be called each time the pattern is reached
   (as long as the pattern is valid, of course).
   </p><p>
   The loop_data parameter is the per-loop data that was previously returned by
   the pattern in the examine_pattern() call.
</p><p>
   <b><i>pattern_invalidated</i></b> is called when any of the write-protected
   regions associated to a found pattern are written to. This is an optional
   function. The per-loop user-data parameter is passed, to be properly free'd
   in a pattern-specific way.
