At the highest level, a Simics configuration is partitioned
into one or multiple <em>simulation cells</em>. Each cell can be
simulated in parallel with the other cells, with maintained determinism.
</p><p>

<div class="caption">Figure 1. Configuration is partitioned into cells.
  Cell membership is
  determined
  <br>by following <i>queue</i> and <i>cell</i>
  attributes to an actual cell object.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Distinct cells are <em>loosely coupled</em>. A typical example is a
multi-machine configuration, where each machine consists of a single cell,
and where the machines are connected with a simulated Ethernet network.
Communication between cells occur through special objects called
<em>links</em> that forward messages between cells.
</p><p>
A device model should not access objects belonging to a different
cell directly.
</p><p>
Each cell is partitioned into one or more
<em>thread domains</em>. Models belonging to different thread domains
can be simulated in parallel. However, objects within a single thread domain
can only be accessed by a single thread at a time, namely by the
<em>thread currently holding the domain</em>.
A thread domain should be thought of as a high-level locking construct
ensuring single-threaded access to the objects it contains.

<div class="caption">Figure 2. Each cell is partitioned into thread domains.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Unlike the cell partitioning, which is static and given by the configuration,
the partitioning of a cell into thread domains is performed by Simics as a
function of the selected simulation mode, model capabilities, and
any declared thread domain constraints.
</p><p>
The thread domains in a cell are not all equal. The thread domain which
contains the cell object itself is special and is called the <b>cell thread
domain</b> (cell TD). Objects residing in this domain use a very permissive
device model, the <b>Standard Device Model</b>, described in
section <a class="reference" href="multithreading-standard-device-model.html">2.6</a>. Among other
things, such models do not need to worry about thread domain boundary
crossings or threading issues. Most models use this device model.
</p><p>
Models located in thread domains other than the cell TD are called
thread-aware, and use the more restrictive <b>Threaded Device Model</b>,
which is described in section <a class="reference" href="multithreading-threaded-cpu.html">2.7</a>.
</p><p>
The threads used to actually simulate the models are usually created by
Simics, but models can also create their own threads. The Simics scheduler is
briefly discussed in section <a class="reference" href="multithreading-scheduler.html">2.9</a>.
