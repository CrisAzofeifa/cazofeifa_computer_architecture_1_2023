<p>
   The <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface is implemented by Simics
   memory-spaces. The interface is used by simulator objects that want to do
   fast accesses to memory and/or want to build up a cached representation of
   memory. These objects are referred to as memory users, e.g., processors.
   Fast accesses are done via host pointers to simulated memory. The
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface is used in conjunction with
   the <code>direct_memory</code> interface which is implemented by objects
   that own the actual data storage, e.g., RAM/ROM objects. These objects are
   called direct-memory objects.
</p><p>
   To access data, a memory-user object first calls the <b><i>lookup</i></b>
   method on the memory space <i>obj</i>. The
   <i>requester</i> is the memory-user doing the lookup.
   The <b><i>lookup</i></b> method traces the range specified by
   <i>addr</i> and <i>size</i>
   through memory spaces and translators until a direct-memory object
   is reached. The direct-memory object is returned in the
   <i>target</i> field and the offset into this object
   corresponding to <i>addr</i> is returned in the
   <i>offs</i> field.
</p><p>
   The call to <b><i>lookup</i></b> fails if the specified range does
   not map continuously to a direct-memory object. A lookup failure
   is indicated by returning NULL in the <i>target</i> field.
</p><p>
   The <i>access</i> argument is a bit field of at least one
   <code>access_t</code> value specifying what kind of accesses the memory user
   is interested in. All specified access types must reach the same
   direct-memory object and range for the lookup to succeed. If the memory
   space, for example, redirects reads and writes to different memory ranges or
   direct-memory objects, a lookup would fail if <i>access</i>
   specified both read and write. Note that the actual access permissions
   needed to access the real data must be requested from
   the direct-memory object using the <b><i>request</i></b> method of
   the <code>direct_memory</code> interface. The <i>access</i>
   argument is only used to locate the direct-memory object.
</p><p>
   The return field <i>access</i> contains at least the access
   bits requested used in the lookup request, but may as an optimization
   contain a superset, indicating that the lookup result is valid for this
   superset. However, there is no guarantee that this optimization
   takes place.
</p><p>
   Once a direct-memory object has been found, the <code>direct_memory</code>
   interface can be used to obtain a direct pointer to the contents
   of the direct-memory object.
</p><p>
   The <i>tracers</i> and <i>breakpoints</i> fields in the
   return value contain information about installed tracers and breakpoints
   that intersect the range. Examples of tracers are timing models
   and snoop objects. In order to trigger breakpoints and invoke any tracers,
   the memory user should perform memory operations using the
   <code>memory_space</code> interface. Only breakpoints and tracers that
   overlap (binary and) with the provided <i>access</i> argument need to be
   considered.
