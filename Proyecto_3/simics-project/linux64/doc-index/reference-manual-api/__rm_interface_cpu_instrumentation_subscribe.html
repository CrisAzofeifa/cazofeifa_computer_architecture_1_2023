<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">The <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface is implemented by
   processor classes that support CPU instrumentation. The interface can be
   used to monitor and instrument various actions through callbacks. It is
   designed for being more efficient than haps and will not synchronize any
   threads. This means that any user of the interface must assume that
   registered callbacks can be called in parallel by multiple threads if any of
   the multi-threaded execution modes are used in Simics.
<p>
   A processor implementing the interface is regarded as a provider of
   instrumentation and is typically used by an instrumentation tool object. The
   tool object is supposed to register callbacks in this interface and act when
   they are called. To handle different threads it is recommended that the
   tools uses a connection object (a sub-object created by the tool) that
   registers these callbacks for each processor that it monitors. Then, any
   data collected can be stored in these connection objects and will thus not
   be subject to concurrent access from different threads that hosts the
   processors. The data can than be aggregated by the tool when
   appropriate. This approach needs no synchronization locks and allows for
   efficient simulation.
</p><p>
   See <code>instrumentation_order</code> interface for more details on the
   callback order.
</p><p>
   The <i>cpu</i> argument in all methods below is the processor object
   implementing this interface.
</p><p>
   The <i>connection</i> argument is the "user" object of this interface,
   typically a connection object as described above. However, it can be any
   object and even NULL if there is no suitable object to pass. For instance,
   if the callback is registered by a Python script. In this case
   synchronization will be handled by the Python layer.
</p><p>
   All registration methods in the interface install at least one callback, the
   <i>cb</i> argument, that will be called at a particular instrumentation
   point in the processor object. The Simics Cell Context API is
   available for use in these callbacks. The callbacks have different
   signatures depending on their use case. The <i>data</i>
   argument is user defined data that can be associated with each
   callback. Every time the callback is called this data will be passed as an
   argument to the callback. The data can be unique for each registration, even
   though the same callback pointer is used.

   <b>Callback Related Methods</b>
</p><p>
   Every function in this interface that registers a callback returns a unique
   handle of type <code>cpu_cb_handle_t</code>. The <b><i>remove_callback</i></b>
   method removes the callback associated with the handle. The
   <b><i>enable_callback</i></b> and <b><i>disable_callback</i></b> methods can be
   used to temporarily enable and disable a callback. 
</p><p>
   The <b><i>remove_connection_callbacks</i></b> removes all callbacks associated
   with a connection object, i.e., all the callbacks that was registered with
   the same connection object. The <b><i>enable_connection_callbacks</i></b> and
   <b><i>disable_connection_callbacks</i></b> enables and disables all callbacks
   associated with a connection object. NULL cannot be passed to these methods
   to handle callbacks installed without any connection object.
</p><p>
   The design philosophy is that registering and removing a callback can be
   relatively expensive, whereas enable and disable a callback should be
   cheap. On the other hand, a disabled callback can slow down the simulation
   speed a bit more compared to running without callbacks.
</p><p>
   <b>Instruction Related Methods</b>
</p><p>
   The method <b><i>register_instruction_before_cb</i></b> installs a callback
   that is called before an instruction is executed. The callback type is as
   follows:
   </p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_instruction_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        instruction_handle_t *handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>
 
</p><p>
   The object <i>obj</i> is the connection or the user object that
   registers the callback (or NULL if there is no object) and <i>cpu</i> is
   the processor object executing the instruction. If a dedicated connection
   object associated with each processor is used, the object's private data can
   store the interface pointers needed to access processor state.  This is a
   useful trick to speed up the simulation speed. Otherwise such interface
   pointers need to be acquired each time the callback is called. If no
   connection object is used the pointers can be saved in the callback's user
   data. The <i>handle</i> can be used to query more data about
   the instruction, using the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code>
   interface. The <i>user_data</i> is the user data associated with the
   callback.
</p><p>
   The registered callback is called for every instruction type. Use the
   <b><i>register_cached_instruction_cb</i></b> method to control which type
   of instructions that should be instrumented.
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_instruction_after_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called
   after an instruction is executed. The callback is of the same type as for
   the before variant and is called for every instruction type. Use the
   <b><i>register_cached_instruction_cb</i></b> method to control which type
   of instructions that should be instrumented. Reading the program counter
   register for a control flow instruction in this callback will reflect the
   new location, whereas using the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> for
   reading out the instruction address will still return the address of the
   control flow instruction.
</p><p>
   None: When an exception occurs the instruction is aborted and any
   installed callbacks by the <b><i>register_instruction_after_cb</i></b> method
   are not called.
</p><p>
   <br>
   <b>Memory Related Methods</b>
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_read_before_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called before
   a memory read operation is performed. The callback type is as follows:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_memory_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        memory_handle_t *handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>
 
   </p><p>
   As for instructions, <i>obj</i> is the object that registered the
   callback and <i>cpu</i> is the processor doing the access.  The
   <i>handle</i> can be used to further operate on the
   access by using the <code>cpu_memory_query</code> interface. The interface
   can for instance be used to read the data of the memory operation. For more
   information, see the documentation for the <code>cpu_memory_query</code>
   interface.
</p><p>
   The <i>scope</i> argument defines the access scope for the
   callback. There are two defined scopes: <code>CPU_Access_Scope_Explicit</code>
   and <code>CPU_Access_Scope_Implicit</code>. The explicit scope installs a
   callback for every operation done explicitly by an instruction, such as
   loading or storing a value. The implicit scope installs a callback for every
   implicit access, such as table walks or memory accesses performed by
   exception and interrupt handling. If all accesses are requested the same
   callback function can be registered for both scopes by registering the
   callback twice, one for each scope. 
</p><p>
   If a memory access crosses a page boundary the access will be split into two
   separate calls, one for the first part covering the first page, and one for
   the second part covering the second page. See the <b><i>get_page_crossing_info</i></b>
   method in the <code>cpu_memory_query</code> interface for a way to
   distinguish the different cases.
</p><p>
   The <i>user_data</i> is the data associated with the callback.
</p><p>
   Similar to <b><i>register_read_before_cb</i></b>, the following three methods
   work in the same way:
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_read_after_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called after
   a memory read operation is performed. 
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_write_before_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called before
   a memory write operation is performed.
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_write_after_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called after
   a memory write operation is performed.
</p><p>
   Memory accesses of prefetch types or any other control operation calls the
   read callbacks. To distinguish them from reads an architecture specific
   interface can be used to lookup the access type. See the
   <code>x86_memory_query</code> interface for example.
</p><p>
   None: When an exception occurs the instruction is aborted and any
   installed memory callbacks after this point are not called.
</p><p>
   <br>
   <b>Addresses</b>
</p><p>
   </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Only available on x86 targets.</div><b><i>register_address_before_cb</i></b> can be used to register a callback
   that will be called each time a logical address is generated by an
   instruction for an explicit read or a write operation. This occurs before
   the actual memory operation takes place. This allows a user to inspect and
   change the target address for the operation. The callback has the following
   signature:
<p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef logical_address_t (*cpu_address_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        logical_address_t address,
        address_handle_t *handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The argument <i>obj</i> is the object installing the callback and the
   <i>cpu</i> is the processor generating the logical
   <i>address</i>. The <i>handle</i> can be used to
   extract more information about the address by using an architecture specific
   interface. See the <code>x86_address_query</code> for details.
</p><p>
   The new logical address should be returned by the callback.
</p><p>
   <br>
   <b>Cached Instructions</b>
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_cached_instruction_cb</i></b> is used for installing a callback
   that is called every time Simics inserts the instruction into an internal
   instruction cache, i.e., executing from a specific address with a specific
   execution mode for the first time. Executing the instruction again will
   typically not invoke the callback since the instruction is already placed in
   the instruction cache. However, if the cache is flushed and the instruction
   is executed again the callback will once again be called. The callback has
   the following signature:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_cached_instruction_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        cached_instruction_handle_t *ci_handle,
        instruction_handle_t *iq_handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   From this callback one can use the <i>cpu_cached_instruction</i>
   interface and <i>ci_handle</i> to register instrumentation callbacks for
   this specific instruction alone. The installed callbacks will be called
   every time the instruction is executed (even the first time just after the
   <code>cpu_cached_instruction_cb_t</code> callback has returned).  
   This means that the
   user can filter out certain instructions of interest and instrument only
   those. The <i>iq_handle</i> and the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code>
   interface can be use to do the filtering by examining the instruction. The
   <i>user_data</i> is the callback user data for the callback.
</p><p>
   For callbacks registered for memory operations only those in the explicit
   scope issued by the instruction will be instrumented, e.g., hardware table
   walks and exceptions will not be considered by this method. To instrument
   these operations use the <b><i>register_(read/write)_(before/after)_cb</i></b>
   with the implicit scope instead.
</p><p>
   If no callbacks are registered by calling the
   <i>cpu_cached_instruction</i> interface, the instruction will not be
   instrumented.
</p><p>
   <br>
   <b>Instruction Set Augmentation</b>
 </p><p>
   <b><i>register_instruction_decoder_cb</i></b> lets the user redefine
   instruction semantics in Simics, or implement new instructions. The
   <i>cb</i> argument is a callback function that will be called every time
   Simics decodes an instruction. From this callback the user can accept the
   instruction or deny it. In most cases this only happens once per instruction
   address since Simics usually caches decoding results in the internal
   instruction cache. If the cache is flushed the callback may be called again.
 </p><p>
   The callback signature looks like this:
   </p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef int (*cpu_instruction_decoder_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        decoder_handle_t *decoder_handle,
        instruction_handle_t *iq_handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The instruction bytes are read by using the <b><i>get_instruction_bytes</i></b>
   method of the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> interface together with
   the <i>iq_handle</i>. The returned value is of a
   <code>cpu_bytes_t</code> type. To access the bytes use the <code>data</code> and
   the <code>size</code> members in the returned value.
</p><p>
   If the decoder requires more bytes (i.e., because the new instruction is
   longer), a negative integer value should be returned by the <i>cb</i>
   function, indicating the number of bytes needed. For example, if the
   available bytes are 3 but the decoder need at least 4 bytes, -4 should be
   returned. The callback will then be called again with more available bytes
   (this can be repeated if the new instruction requires even more bytes at
   this point). Note that requesting more data than actual needed can cause
   spurious page faults if the data crosses a page boundary. 
</p><p>
   If the instruction is accepted by the callback a positive integer number
   should be returned corresponding to the length of the instruction. In this
   case the <b><i>register_emulation_cb</i></b> method of the
   <code>cpu_instruction_decoder</code> interface should be called to set the
   actual (user) function that Simics will call each time the instruction is
   executed. 
</p><p>
   If the <i>cb</i> callback should ignore the instruction the number 0
   should be returned. This means that any other registered decoder will have a
   chance to decode the instruction. If no decoder accepts it, Simics' default
   implementation will be used.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_emulation_cb</i></b> method also needs the
   <i>decoder_handle</i> which is available in the dedoder callback. For
   more information, see the documentation of the
   <code>cpu_instruction_decoder</code> interface.
</p><p>
   A <i>disass_cb</i> argument should also be passed to the
   <b><i>register_instruction_decoder_cb</i></b> method. This function is called
   every time Simics wants to disassemble an instruction. For every accepted
   instruction a corresponding disassembly string should be returned by this
   function. It has the following signature:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef tuple_int_string_t (*cpu_instruction_disassemble_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        generic_address_t addr,
        cpu_bytes_t bytes);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   <i>obj</i> is the object registering the
   <b><i>register_instruction_decoder_cb</i></b> and <i>cpu</i> is the
   processor disassembling the instruction. <b><i>addr</i></b> is the address of
   the instruction in a generic form. This means that it is typically a
   physical address or a logical address depending on the context of the
   disassembling. The address can be used for offset calculations, i.e.,
   displaying an absolute address instead of a relative one, for example in a
   branch instruction. The <i>bytes</i> argument should be used to read
   instruction bytes. The return value is of type
   <code>tuple_int_string_t</code> and should be filled with the instruction
   length and an allocated (e.g., malloc) string representing the disassembly
   of the instruction. The ownership of the string is transferred to the
   calling environment which will free it when it is no longer needed.
</p><p>
   If too few bytes are passed for the instruction to be disassembled a
   negative value should be returned for the length indicating the needed
   bytes. The <i>disass_cb</i> is then called again with more bytes. If the
   instruction is rejected a length of 0 should be returned and the string
   should be set to NULL.

   <b>Exception Related Methods</b>
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_exception_before_cb</i></b> is used to register a callback that
   will be called before an exception or interrupt is taken.  The
   <i>exception_number</i> can be used to select a callback on a specific
   exception, with the same number as used in the <code>exception</code>
   interface. If all exceptions should be subscribed to, the
   <code>CPU_Exception_All</code> constant can be used.
   The callback signature looks like this:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_exception_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        exception_handle_t *exception_handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

   </p><p>
   The <i>obj</i> is the object registering the callback and <i>cpu</i>
   is the processor that takes the exception or receives the interrupt. The
   handle is used to get more architectural information about the exception,
   for example, see the <code>x86_exception_query</code> for details. The
   <i>user_data</i> is the callback user data.
</p><p>
   No architectural state has been changed in this callback to reflect the
   exception or interrupt, e.g., the program counter will still be at the
   faulting instruction. Since an exception can occur while handling an
   exception it is not always the case that this callback corresponds to the
   final taken exception. Recursive exception will result in another call to
   this callback.
  </p><p>
   <b><i>register_exception_after_cb</i></b> is used to register a callback that
   will be called after an exception was taken. It takes the same arguments as
   <b><i>register_exception_before_cb</i></b>. In this callback the architectural
   state has been updated, e.g., the program counter points to the first
   instruction of the exception handler. The callback is of the same type as
   for the before variant.
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_exception_return_before_cb</i></b> is used to register a
   callback that will be called just before an exception handler is done and
   resumes execution of the normal program code.  The callback signature looks
   like this:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_exception_return_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        exception_return_handle_t *exception_handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

   </p><p>
   The <i>obj</i> is the object registering the callback and <i>cpu</i>
   is the processor that takes the exception or receives an interrupt. The
   handle is used to get more architectural information about the
   exception. Currently there is no interface available for this.
   </p><p>
   <b><i>register_exception_return_after_cb</i></b> is used to register a callback
   that will be called after an exception has been executed, e.g., the program
   counter points to the normal program where execution will continue.
</p><p>
   <br>
   <b>Execution Mode</b>
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_mode_change_cb</i></b> is used to register a callback that will
   be called every time the processor changes mode. The supported modes are:
   user, supervisor, and hypervisor.
</p><p>
   The callback signature looks lite this:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_mode_change_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        processor_mode_t old_mode, processor_mode_t new_mode,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The <i>obj</i> is the object registering the callback and <i>cpu</i>
   is the processor that changes mode. The <i>old_mode</i> is the mode
   before the change and new_mode is the mode after the change.
</p><p>
   <br>
   <b>Control Registers</b>
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_control_register_read_before_cb</i></b> is used to register a
   callback that will be called before every control register read. The
   <i>register_number</i> is the control register number to install the
   callback on. It is the same number which is used in the
   <code>int_register</code> interface. The constant
   <code>CPU_Control_Register_All</code> can be used to subscribe to all control
   registers.
</p><p>
   The callback signature looks like this:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_control_register_read_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        int register_number,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The <i>obj</i> is the object registering the callback and <i>cpu</i>
   is the processor that reads the control register <i>register_number</i>.
   The <i>user_data</i> is the user data for the callback.
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_control_register_write_before_cb</i></b> is used to register a
   callback that will be called before every control register write. The
   <i>register_number</i> is the control register number to install the
   callback on. It is the same number which is used in the
   <code>int_register</code> interface. The constant
   <code>CPU_Control_Register_All</code> can be used to subscribe to all control
   registers. 
</p><p>
   The callback signature looks like this:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_control_register_write_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        int register_number,
        uint64 value,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The <i>obj</i> is the object registering the callback and <i>cpu</i>
   is the processor that writes to the control register
   <i>register_number</i>.  The <i>value</i> is the value that will be
   written.  The <i>user_data</i> is the user data for the callback.
