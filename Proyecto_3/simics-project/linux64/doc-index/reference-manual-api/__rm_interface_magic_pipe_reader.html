<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">An interface for reading received data from a magic pipe application running
  in the target system. This interface is called by a simics extension running
  in the host system communicating with a target application via a magic
  pipe. The communication is identified by a magic number. These numbers are
  acquired or reserved in the magic_pipe_setup_interface.
<p>
  The magic pipe library on the target system allocates a page-locked pipe
  buffer for the target application, which uses the buffer to communicate data
  to and from the host system. That buffer is fragmented when read by the host
  system and therefore copied into a new unfragmented buffer, which is used for
  all read accesses in this interface. All C-code readewr callback functions
  are allowed direct access to this memory area, while Python reader callback
  functions require another copy for ownership reasons.
</p><p>
  This interface does not modify the pipe buffer data in any way, and the
  callers are not allowed to do that neither. It is therefore safe for several
  readers to subscribe to the same data.

    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
This interface is an experimental feature. It is excluded from
  the standard support program, and is subject to change or removal
  without notice.</div><pre class="jdocu_small">SIM_INTERFACE(magic_pipe_reader) {
