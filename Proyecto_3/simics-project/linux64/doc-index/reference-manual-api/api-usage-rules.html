  </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Simics-API-value-ownership-rules">1.3.1 Simics API value ownership rules</a></h2>
<p>
  
  <a name="ownership"></a><a name="deallocation"></a>
</p><p>
  The <em>owner</em> of a value in memory is the code or object
  responsible for freeing the value when it is no longer needed.
  Failure to do so may cause excessive memory consumption
  (a <em><a name="memory-leak">memory leak</a></em>). Deallocation of objects that
  are not owned, or use of objects after they have been freed, will
  likely result in a crash.
  </p><p>
  The ownership rules only apply to code written in C, C++ and DML.
  In <a name="Python">Python</a>, <a name="memory-management">memory management</a> is entirely
  automatic.
  </p><p>
  The general rules in Simics are:
</p><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      <em>The caller of a function retains ownership of the arguments
      it passes to that function.</em> Called functions do not assume
      ownership of the arguments they receive.
    </li>
    <li>
      <em>The caller of a function receives ownership of the value
      returned from that function.</em> Called functions must relinquish
      ownership of values they return.
    </li>
    <li>
      A return type <code>const T *</code>, for some
      type <code>T</code>, is taken to mean that ownership of the
      returned value is <em>not</em> transferred to the caller,
      overriding the previous rule.
    </li>
  </ul>
      <p>
  Exceptions to the rules above are documented for each interface or
  API call.
</p><p>
  Each data type has its own way of deallocation. It is generally
  documented where objects of that type are created; see below for
  some specific examples.
  </p><p>
  </p><dl><dt id="dt:strings"><b>Strings</b></dt><dd>Null-terminated <a name="strings">strings</a> are freed using
      <b><i><a name="MM_FREE">MM_FREE</a></i></b> in C/C++,
      <code><a name="delete">delete</a></code> in DML. They are created using
      <b><i><a name="MM_MALLOC">MM_MALLOC</a></i></b>, <b><i><a name="MM_STRDUP">MM_STRDUP</a></i></b>
      or other functions that create heap-allocated strings.
      (The standard C library functions <b><i><a name="malloc">malloc</a></i></b>,
      <b><i><a name="free">free</a></i></b> etc should <em>not</em> be used.)
<p>
      The pointer-to-<code>const</code> rule applies: a string
      returned as <code><a name="char-">char *</a></code> becomes owned by the
      caller, but not one returned as
      <code><a name="const-char-">const char *</a></code>.
    </p></dd><dt id="dt:attribute-values"><b>Attribute values</b></dt><dd>Values of type <code><a name="attr_value_t">attr_value_t</a></code> are freed
      using <b><i><a name="SIM_attr_free">SIM_attr_free</a></i></b>.
<p>
      Since the values may refer to heap-allocated data, they cannot
      be copied by simple (shallow) assignment. To create a (deep)
      copy of an <code>attr_value_t</code> that is safe to access
      after the original has been freed,
      use <b><i><a name="SIM_attr_copy">SIM_attr_copy</a></i></b>.
</p><p>
      The <code>attr_value_t</code> accessor functions return values
      that borrow references to parts of the argument. Therefore, the
      returned values cannot be altered, and cannot be used beyond
      the life-time of the argument. (This obviously does not apply
      to non-allocated values such as numbers or booleans.)
    </p></dd><dt id="dt:simics-managed-types"><b>Simics-managed types</b></dt><dd>Values of some types are always owned and managed by Simics
      itself and should never be freed by the user. Examples are
      <code><a name="conf_object_t">conf_object_t</a></code>
      and <code><a name="conf_class_t">conf_class_t</a></code>.
    </dd></dl><p>
  </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="api-execution-contexts">1.3.2 API Execution Contexts</a></h2>
<p>
  
  </p><p>
  The set of Simics API functions and interface methods that can be
  called at a given point depends on the state of the execution thread
  at the time of the call. The thread states are classified into
  <em><a name="API-execution-contexts">API execution contexts</a></em>. Three distinct execution
  contexts are defined, and they are inclusive, as illustrated in
  the figure below:
</p><p>
  </p><div class="figure">

    <div style="text-align: center">
      <img alt="" src="execution-context.png">
      <div class="caption">The execution context defines the part of the Simics API that
	may be used</div>
    </div>
  </div>

<p>
  <br>Below is a description of the defined execution contexts:
  </p><dl><dt id="dt:global-context"><b><a name="Global-Context">Global Context</a></b></dt><dd>Previously, this context was known as Outside Execution Context (OEC).
<p>
      The most permissive context. A thread running in
      Global Context has exclusive access to all objects in the simulation.
      </p><p>
      In Global Context, either the simulation is not running or
      all simulation activity
      has temporarily been suspended. The front-end runs in this
      context, as do the callbacks from <b><i><a name="SIM_run_alone">SIM_run_alone</a></i></b>,
      <b><i><a name="SIM_thread_safe_callback">SIM_thread_safe_callback</a></i></b> and
      <b><i><a name="SIM_notify_on_socket">SIM_notify_on_socket</a></i></b> with the
      <i>run_in_thread</i> argument set to 0. Module initialisation,
      object creation and object destruction are also performed in
      this context.
  </p><p>
      The full API is available, including functions
      and methods documented as callable in other contexts.
    </p></dd><dt id="dt:cell-context-ec-ic"><b><a name="Cell-Context">Cell Context</a> (<a name="ECIC">EC/IC</a>)</b></dt><dd>This is a single context which was introduced in Simics 6 instead
      of Execution Context (EC) and Instruction Context (IC) that were
      around before.
<p>
      The context used for most device simulation. Typically used
      when the simulation is running.
</p><p>
      Only functions and methods documented as callable in
      Cell Context or Threaded Context are available in this context.
</p><p>
      Other objects in the simulation may be accessed or referenced,
      but only objects belonging to the same <em>simulation cell</em>.
      The cell concept is discussed in some detail in section
      <a class="reference" href="multithreading-simulation-cells.html">2.3</a>, but basically
      it is a partitioning of the simulation into groups of objects.
      Cell Context is always tied to a specific cell.
      </p><p>
      Most device code run in this context, for instance when
      a CPU accesses a device register, as do event callbacks
      and many hap handlers.
    </p></dd><dt id="dt:threaded-context"><b><a name="Threaded-Context">Threaded Context</a></b></dt><dd>Previously, this context was known as Foreign Thread Context (FTC).
<p>
      The most restrictive context, denoting a thread which is 
      in neither Cell Context nor Global Context.
</p><p>
      Manually created threads and <b><i>SIM_run_in_thread</i></b> callbacks
      are examples where this context is applicable.
      Thread-aware models, like a CPU with support for multicore threading,
      also perform most of its simulation in Threaded Context.
      </p><p>
      The available API is limited to functions explicitly
      declared as being available in Threaded Context, but
      a more permissive context can be entered when needed. For example,
      <b><i><a name="SIM_thread_safe_callback2">SIM_thread_safe_callback</a></i></b> posts a
      callback which is invoked in Global Context, and
      Cell Context can be reached with
      the <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_CELL</i></b> primitive.
</p><p>
      While objects can be accessed in this context, it is only permitted
      after special primitives are used to ensure single-threaded access.
      This usually amounts to entering Cell Context, but
      thread-aware models can actually access their own object
      state directly from Threaded Context. This is discussed in
      chapter <a class="reference" href="rmapi-threading-model.html">2</a>.
    </p></dd></dl><p>The reference manuals detail the permitted API execution context for
  each API function and interface method. Calls are allowed in the
  specified and more permissive contexts.
  </p><p>
  Violations of the API execution context rules have undefined
  consequences. They may result in warnings or error messages, but this
  is not guaranteed. In particular, a class implementing an interface
  method is under no obligation to perform any such checks.
