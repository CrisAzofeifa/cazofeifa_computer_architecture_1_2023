<p>
   This interface is used to register callbacks to instrument ram/rom accesses.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_access_before_cb</i></b> method registers a callback that is
   called before any memory access reached the backing storage in a ram/rom
   image. This makes it possible to modify the transaction before it reaches
   its destination. See the documentation of the <code>ram_access_cb_t</code>
   type for more information. A <code>ram_cb_handle_t</code> pointer is
   returned as a reference to the callback.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_access_after_cb</i></b> method registers a callback that is
   called after any memory access has reached the backing storage in a ram/rom
   image. This makes it possible to modify the transaction after the access is
   completed. See the documentation of the <code>ram_access_cb_t</code>
   type for more information. A <code>ram_cb_handle_t</code> pointer is
   returned as a reference to the callback.
</p><p>
   Both of these register callbacks above will receive all types of accesses,
   read, write, or execute, from any initiator hitting any address range. It is
   up to the callback to filter the information if needed, e.g., to only trace
   read accesses. Normally, ram/rom pages can be cached in object using them by
   using the <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface. This caching must
   be blocked by this interface to allow the callbacks to be called. This has
   severe impact on simulation speed. However, the following method should be
   used to allow caching for accesses that the callbacks have no interest in.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_access_filter_cb</i></b> method can be used to register a
   function callback that allows ram/rom pages to be cached by a user of the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface. If caching is allowed the
   access may be invisible to the callbacks installed by
   <b><i>register_access_before_cb</i></b> and <b><i>register_access_after_cb</i></b>
   methods above. Even if an access is allowed to be cached it does not mean
   that it will be, which means that the callbacks can be called anyway.
</p><p>
   See the documentation of the <code>access_filter_cb_t</code> type for more
   information about the callback and how to allow caching. A
   <code>ram_cb_handle_t</code> pointer is returned as a reference to the
   callback.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>remove_callback</i></b> method removes an earlier installed
   callback. The handle is used to identify the callback to be removed. All
   register function above returns such handle.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>enable_callback</i></b> and <b><i>disable_callback</i></b> methods
   temporarily enables and disables a previously installed
   callback. The handle is used to identify the callback. All
   register function above returns such handle.
