<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">This interface allows registration of callbacks for individual instructions,
   i.e., instructions at a specific address.  This interface can only be used
   inside a <code>cpu_cached_instruction_cb_t</code> callback where there is a
   valid <i>ci_handle</i>. The callback is installed by calling the
   <b><i>register_cached_instruction_cb</i></b> method in the
   <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface. The signature of the
   callback function looks like this:
<p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_cached_instruction_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        cached_instruction_handle_t *ci_handle,
        instruction_handle_t *iq_handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   When the callback is installed Simics will call it every time an instruction
   is put into the internal instruction cache, which might have different
   entries for different execution modes. For example, in an unlikely case
   where the same instruction is executed in 32-bit mode and later in 64-bit
   mode (running an x86 processor for instance), this callback will be called
   twice, one time for each mode. This allows the user to install specific
   callbacks for this specific instruction and apply filtering based on
   instruction types, etc. This approach is more efficient than doing dynamic
   filtering in the instruction and read/write callbacks installed by the
   <b><i>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</i></b> interface.
</p><p>
   The <i>iq_handle</i> together with the
   <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> interface let a user examine
   instruction properties. The <i>user_data</i> is the user data for the
   callback.

   The method <b><i>register_instruction_before_cb</i></b> installs a callback
   that is called before the cached instruction is executed. The
   <i>ci_handle</i> is used to bind the callback to the cached instruction.
   The <i>user_data</i> is the callback's user data, and a callback for
   freeing the data is also available. The <i>free_cb</i> looks like this:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_callback_free_user_data_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu, lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>

</p><p>
   It is called when Simics wants to free cached instructions, which can happen
   in various situations. <i>obj</i> is the connection object that should
   free the data. The callback may be NULL if not needed.
</p><p>
   The <i>cb</i> callback type is the same as used for instructions in the
   <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface:
   </p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_instruction_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        instruction_handle_t *handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>
 
</p><p>
   The object <i>obj</i> is the user object that registers the callback and
   <i>cpu</i> is the processor object executing the instruction. The
   <i>handle</i> can be used to query more data about the instruction. See
   the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> interface for more information. The
   <i>user_data</i> is the user data associated with the callback.
</p><p>
   The user data is a convenient location for storing information about the
   instruction, such as user specific decode information, etc. The user data is
   private for each installed callback.
</p><p>
   The cached information about the instruction is bound to its physical
   address so the logical address cannot typically be saved since it may vary
   between calls (if the MMU-mapping has changed).
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_instruction_after_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called
   after a cached instruction is executed. Otherwise it works in the same as
   the before variant.
   However, reading the program counter register for a control flow instruction
   in this callback will reflect the new location, whereas using the
   <code>cpu_instruction_query</code> for reading out the instruction address
   will still return the address of the control flow instruction.
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_read_before_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called before
   each read operation in the cached instruction. The callback is the
   same as used for read and writes in the
   <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface:
</p><p>
   
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*cpu_memory_cb_t)(
        conf_object_t *obj, conf_object_t *cpu,
        memory_handle_t *handle,
        lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>
 
   </p><p>
   As for instructions, <i>obj</i> is the object that registered the
   callback and <i>cpu</i> is the processor doing the access.  The
   <i>handle</i> can be used to further operate on the access by using the
   <code>cpu_memory_query</code> interface. The
   <i>user_data</i> and the <i>free_cb</i> arguments to
   <b><i>register_read_before_cb</i></b> can be used to store user data for the
   read operations in the cached instruction. The user data is private for each
   installed callback but is shared between all read before operations in the
   instruction. 
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_read_after_cb</i></b> installs a callback that is called after
   each read operation in the cached instruction. The user data is private for
   each installed callback but is shared between all read after operations in
   the instruction. Otherwise it works in the same way as the before variant.
</p><p>
   <b><i>register_write_before_cb</i></b> and <b><i>register_write_after_cb</i></b>
   installs callbacks that is called before and after each write operation in
   the cached instructions. Otherwise they work in the same way as the read
   variants.
</p><p>
   Note that installing a read or write callback on an instruction without any
   memory operations will be useless.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>add_counter</i></b> method can be used to add simple counters for
   this particular instruction. The <i>counter</i> argument is a pointer to
   a 64 bit counter value that will be incremented each time the instruction is
   executed. This is the same thing (but more efficient) as registering a
   callback through the <b><i>register_instruction_before_cb</i></b> method and
   increasing the counter each time it is called.
</p><p>
   Passing true for the argument <i>use_atomic_increment</i> makes the
   increment of the counter atomic, which may be useful if the tool cannot have
   an instrumentation connection per processor. This will however be slower due
   to the nature of atomic instructions.
</p><p>
   The location of the counter value can only be removed/deallocated after a
   call to either the <b><i>remove_callback</i></b> method (passing the
   <code>cpu_cb_handle_t</code> returned by
   <b><i>register_cached_instruction_cb</i></b>), or to the
   <b><i>remove_connection_callbacks</i></b> method (with the connection object as
   the argument) in the <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe interface</code>.
</p><p>
   This method is not available in Python.
</p><p>
   The <code>instrumentation_order</code> interface cannot be used to
   reorder callbacks installed with the <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code>
   interface. The cached callbacks are always called in same order as the 
   <b><i>cpu_cached_instruction_cb_t</i></b> callback that installed them, 
   and before any callback installed by the corresponding methods in the 
   <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code>.
