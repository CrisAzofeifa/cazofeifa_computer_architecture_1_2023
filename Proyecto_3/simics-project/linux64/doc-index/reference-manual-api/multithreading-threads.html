<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="multithreading-threads">2.8 Foreign Threads</a></h1>
<p>

Threads created explicitly by models are called <em>foreign threads</em>.
Such threads run in Threaded Context. There are also
various API functions that registers callbacks that are called in FTC, like
<b><i>SIM_run_in_thread</i></b> and <b><i>SIM_notify_on_socket</i></b> with
the <i>run_in_thread</i> argument set to 1.
</p><p>
Many of the things stated in the preceding section is also relevant to foreign
threads. One difference, however, is that foreign threads can be created by
models using the Standard Device Model.

<p>

The following outlines how a foreign thread can interact with the
rest of the simulation:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:accessing-a-device-object"><b>Accessing a Device Object</b></dt><dd>A foreign thread can enter Cell Context using the
    <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_CELL</i></b> function. Once in Cell Context, the thread
    can interact with the object just like a normal device would do,
    and without needing any additional locking.
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      /* foreign thread */
      SIM_ACQUIRE_CELL(obj, &amp;lock);
      /* safe to access the device */
      SIM_RELEASE_CELL(obj, &amp;lock);
    </pre><p>
  </p></dd><dt id="dt:entering-global-context"><b>Entering Global Context</b></dt><dd>A foreign thread can post callbacks that are run
    in Global Context, and hence
    allowed to access everything in the simulation. This
    is done using <b><i>SIM_thread_safe_callback</i></b>
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      static void
      global_context_callback(void *data)
      {
          /* this code runs in Global Context */
      }

      {
          /* ... Threaded Context ... */
          SIM_thread_safe_callback(global_context_callback, data);
      }
    </pre><p>
    It should be noted that the function posting the callback returns
    immediately, usually before the callback has started executing. Also,
    posting a Global Context callback is a relatively expensive operation
    since it involves stopping all running CPUs.
