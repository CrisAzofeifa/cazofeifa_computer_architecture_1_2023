<p>

A device model can run in one of three concurrency modes. The modes are as
follows:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:sim_concurrency_mode_serialized"><b><code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized</code></b></dt><dd>The model can assume Cell Context.
<p>
    The model is put in the cell thread domain.
</p><p>
    The device may interact with all
    objects in the cell without having to acquire any thread domains or take
    threading into account.
   </p><p>
    Objects in the same cell, including objects belonging in other
    thread domains, always have a stable state when queried.
</p><p>
    The direct memory subsystem ensures that there is no observable
    concurrency on memory pages held by the model.
  </p></dd><dt id="dt:sim_concurrency_mode_serialized_memory"><b><code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized_Memory</code></b></dt><dd>The model runs in Threaded Context.
<p>
    The model is put in a separate thread domain.
</p><p>
    The model is required to handle locking explicitly for both incoming and
    outgoing interface calls.
</p><p>
    Whenever the model crosses a thread domain boundary, or enters
    Cell Context, all devices
    in the cell can potentially undergo state transitions.
</p><p>
    The direct memory subsystem ensures that there is no observable
    concurrency on memory pages held by the model.
  </p></dd><dt id="dt:sim_concurrency_mode_full"><b><code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Full</code></b></dt><dd>The model runs in Threaded Context.
<p>
    The model is put in a separate thread domain.
</p><p>
    The model is required to handle locking explicitly for both incoming and
    outgoing interface calls.
</p><p>
    Whenever the model crosses a thread domain boundary, or enters
    Cell Context, all devices
    in the cell can potentially undergo state transitions.
</p><p>
    The model cannot assume that pages granted through the direct-memory
    subsystem are not accessed concurrently from a different thread, unless
    exclusive access have been requested explicitly.
  </p></dd></dl><p></p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The concurrency mode basically only affects two things directly:
  <ol><li>whether the model
      is put in the cell thread domain or not</li>
	<li>whether the direct memory
  system automatically prevents concurrent access to granted pages</li></ol>
</div><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Mode-Selection">2.5.1 Mode Selection</a></h2>
<p>A model advertises its supported concurrency modes through the
<code>concurrency_mode</code> interface. If the interface is omitted,
and the object is not grouped with an object implementing the
<code>concurrency_mode</code> interface (see the next section), then the
model is assumed to only support
<code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized</code>.
</p><p>
If the model support multiple modes, the interface is also used by
Simics to select the concurrency mode the model should use. The mode
is derived from the simulation mode set through the
<b>set-threading-mode</b> command.
</p><p>
Device models normally run in the serialized concurrency mode, whereas
CPU models preferably should support all the modes.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The <b>set-threading-mode</b> command is used by the user to set
  the threading mode of the simulation.
<p>
  The <em>"serialized"</em> mode puts models in the <b>serialized</b>
  concurrency mode.
  </p><p>
  The <em>"subsystem"</em> mode configures models to use the <b>serialized
    memory</b> concurrency mode, if supported, and <b>serialized</b> mode
  otherwise.
</p><p>
  The <em>"multicore"</em> mode configures models to use the <b>full</b>
  concurrency mode, if supported, and <b>serialized memory</b> or
  just <b>serialized</b> mode otherwise.
</p></div>
<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Thread-Domain-Groups">2.5.2 Thread Domain Groups</a></h2>
<p>
  
In many cases, there are multiple objects that should reside
in the same thread domain. Examples include:
</p><ul>
  <li>a CPU and an object representing its TLB</li>
  <li>a CPU and a CPU-specific timer</li>
  <li>two hyper threads which share a substantial amount of registers
    and whose implementation is not thread safe</li>
</ul>
When forming thread domain groups, Simics queries all objects implementing
the <code>concurrency_group</code> interface. The interface returns
constraints of the type "these objects should be put in the same thread domain",
and they are of two kinds:
<ol>
  <li>constraints that are used in <b>all</b> concurrency modes</li>
  <li>constraints that are only used in the <b>serialized memory</b> mode.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
A <em>port object</em> is always placed in the same thread domain as
its parent, unless it implements the <em>concurrency_mode</em> interface
or is grouped explicitly with such an object.
</p><p>
For CPU models, the following is recommended:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:sim_concurrency_mode_serialized_memory-2"><b><code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized_Memory</code></b></dt><dd>Tightly connected CPUs are grouped together.
<p>
    In this context, tightly connected really means CPUs that run
    the same OS instance. CPUs which run distinct OS instances,
    but share memory, or devices, through
    some fabric, do not need to be placed in the same group.
  </p></dd><dt id="dt:sim_concurrency_mode_full-2"><b><code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Full</code></b></dt><dd>All CPU cores are placed in separate thread domains.
  </dd></dl><p>The above allows groups of tightly coupled CPUs
to be simulated in parallel when the simulation is configured
to use <b>subsystem</b> threading, while allowing all the CPUs to
run in parallel in <b>multicore</b> mode.
