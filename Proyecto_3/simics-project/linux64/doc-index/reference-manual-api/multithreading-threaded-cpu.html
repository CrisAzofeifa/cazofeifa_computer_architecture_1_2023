<p>

An object using one of the concurrency modes
<code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Serialized_Memory</code> or 
<code>Sim_Concurrency_Mode_Full</code> is called a <em>thread-aware</em>
model. The Threaded Device Model must be followed by such objects.
</p><p>
Thread-aware models run mostly in Threaded Context.
</p><p>
This section primarily discusses thread-aware models, but much of the
contents also applies to code invoked directly from a "foreign" thread.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
A CPU is the typical example of a thread-aware model. Most devices should
  rather use the Standard Device Model.
</div><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Programming-Model">2.7.1 Programming Model</a></h2>
<p>Thread-aware models need to take the following into account:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:incoming-interface-calls"><b>Incoming Interface Calls</b></dt><dd>Interfaces implemented by thread-aware models can be invoked in
    Threaded Context rather than Cell Context, and the thread
    domain associated with the object cannot be assumed to be held on entry.
    <p>
    It is the responsibility of the model to ensure that its state is
    protected, usually by calling <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_OBJECT</i></b>
    from its interface methods, as in the following example:
    </p><pre class="jdocu_small">      static void
      some_interface_method(conf_object *obj)
      {
          domain_lock_t *lock;
          SIM_ACQUIRE_OBJECT(obj, &amp;lock);
          /* ... internal state is protected by the TD ... */
          SIM_RELEASE_OBJECT(obj, &amp;lock);
      }
    </pre><p>
    No extra protection is needed for interfaces which are only available
    in OEC. All thread domains are already held on entry.
    </p><p>
    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
There are a few situations when the model is invoked with
      its thread domain already held:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The <b><i>run</i></b> method of the <code>execute</code>
	  interface is invoked with the object's thread domain held.
	  The model should not acquire the domain again, since this
	  would block the signaling mechanism used to notify the model
	  when another thread tries to acquire the domain.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The methods in the the <code>direct_memory_update</code>
	  interface are always invoked with the thread domain held.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </div></dd><dt id="dt:outgoing-interface-calls"><b>Outgoing Interface Calls</b></dt><dd>When a thread-aware model invokes an interface method on an
    object which is not known to reside in the same thread domain,
    then the call must be protected with <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_TARGET</i></b>,
    with the interface object provided as an argument.
    This ensures that Cell Context is entered, when necessary.
<p>
    Example of an "outgoing" interface call:
    </p><pre class="jdocu_small">      domain_lock_t *lock;
      /* incoming interface calls may occur here */
      SIM_ACQUIRE_TARGET(target_obj, &amp;lock);
      some_interface-&gt;some_method(target_obj, ...);
      SIM_RELEASE_TARGET(target_obj, &amp;lock);
    </pre><p>
</p><p>
    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
If the target object is thread-aware, then
      <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_TARGET</i></b> will actually be a no-op.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
If the cell TD is busy when <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_TARGET</i></b> is executed,
      then the model may see incoming interface calls while waiting for the
      domain, since all held domains are temporarily released while
      waiting.
    </div></dd><dt id="dt:api-calls"><b>API Calls</b></dt><dd>Cell Context must be entered before any API function can be called
    which requires this context. The context is entered with
    the <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_CELL</i></b> primitive, as in this example:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      domain_lock_t *lock;
      /* incoming interface calls may occur here */
      SIM_ACQUIRE_CELL(obj, &amp;lock);
      /* this code runs in Cell Context */
      breakpoint_id = SIM_breakpoint(...);
      SIM_RELEASE_CELL(obj, &amp;lock);
    </pre><p>
    Some functions that need this protection:
    </p><ul>
      <li>HAP functions (<b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback</i></b>, ...)</li>
      <li><b><i>SIM_breakpoint</i></b>, <b><i>SIM_delete_breakpoint</i></b></li>
      <li><b><i>SIM_issue_transaction</i></b></li>
    </ul>
<p>
    There are, however, many functions that can be called directly
    in Threaded Context, e.g.
    </p><ul>
      <li>functions performing logging (<b><i>SIM_log_info</i></b>, ...)</li>
      <li>functions returning constant object properties
	(<b><i>SIM_object_name</i></b>, <b><i>SIM_get_interface</i></b>, ...)</li>
      <li>allocations (<b><i>MM_MALLOC</i></b>,
	<b><i>SIM_alloc_attr_list</i></b>, ...)</li>
      <li>accessors (<b><i>SIM_attr_integer</i></b>,
	<b><i>SIM_transaction_is_read</i></b>, ...)</li>
      <li>dbuffer API (but the dbuffer itself is <b>not</b> thread safe)</li>
      <li><b><i>SIM_run_unrestricted</i></b>, <b><i>SIM_run_alone</i></b></li>
    </ul>
    Some API functions can be called directly, as long as the TD has
    been acquired for the object in question:
    <ul>
      <li>event related functions (<b><i>SIM_event_post_cycle</i></b>, ...)</li>
      <li>time related functions (<b><i>SIM_time</i></b>,
	<b><i>SIM_cycle_count</i></b>, ...)</li>
    </ul>
  </dd><dt id="dt:callbacks"><b>Callbacks</b></dt><dd>Callbacks triggered by the model are often expected to
    be dispatched in Cell Context. The model must
    enter Cell Context using <b><i>SIM_ACQUIRE_CELL</i></b>
    before dispatching such callbacks.
<p>
    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Events registered with the <code>Sim_Event_No_Serialize</code> flag
      and callbacks used by the CPU instrumentation framework do not need to be
      protected. For these callbacks, it is the callee's responsibility to be
      aware that the context can be more limited than Cell Context.
      This is a performance optimization to allow fast callbacks with
      minimal overhead.
    </div></dd><dt id="dt:attributes"><b>Attributes</b></dt><dd>Registered attribute setters and getters are automatically protected;
    an object's thread domain is always held when attribute setters and getters
    are invoked.
<p>
    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Attributes should be used for configuration and to hold
      state. Attributes should <b>never</b> be used for communication between
      objects during simulation.
    </div></dd></dl><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Domain-Boundary-Crossings">2.7.2 Domain Boundary Crossings</a></h2>
<p>

Whenever a thread-domain boundary is crossed, already held
domains may temporarily be released to avoid deadlock situations.
This allows unrelated, incoming, interface calls to occur at such points.
</p><p>
A thread-aware model must ensure that potential state changes caused
by incoming interface calls are taken into account. This is one of the
challenging points when writing a thread-aware model.
</p><p>
In Cell Context, boundary crossings are not an issue, since this
context is prioritized exactly to avoid unexpected
interface calls. Thread-aware models, running in Threaded Context,
are not as fortunate and need to be aware of the possibility.
</p><p>
It is recommended that incoming interface calls are kept as
simple as possible for thread-aware models. If possible,
the interface action should be deferred and handled from an
inner loop, especially for CPUs. For instance, a RESET interface
should not perform the reset immediately, but instead set a flag that
a reset should be performed before dispatching the next instruction.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Mixing-Thread-Domains-and-Mutexes">2.7.3 Mixing Thread Domains and Mutexes</a></h2>
<p>

It is easy to run into problems when different locking schemes
are combined. This is also the case when mixing <em>mutexes</em>
and <em>thread domains</em>. The following examples illustrate some
pitfalls:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:example-1"><b>Example 1</b></dt><dd>Acquiring a thread domain while holding a lock:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      Thread 1                  Thread 2
      Locks Mutex1              Acquires TD1
      Acquires TD1 (blocks)     Locks Mutex1 (blocks)
    </pre><p>
    Thread 1 will never be able to acquire TD1 since this domain is held by
    thread 2 which blocks on Mutex1.
</p><p>
    Note that the above example will also cause a deadlock if two mutexes
    are used rather than one mutex and one thread domain, whereas no
    no deadlock occurs with two thread domains.
  </p></dd><dt id="dt:example-2"><b>Example 2</b></dt><dd>Waiting for a condition variable while holding a thread domain:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">      Thread 1               Thread 2
      Acquires TD1           .
      Waits for COND1	     Acquires TD1 (blocks)
                             Releases TD1 (not reached)
	                     .
                             Signals COND1 (not reached)
    </pre><p>
    Sleeping on a condition while holding a thread domain easily
    leads to deadlocks. Threads requiring the thread domain
    will get stuck and potentially prevent the condition from being
    signaled.
  </p></dd></dl><p>In practice, code can seldom make assumptions about which thread domains
are held. For instance, an interface function can be invoked with an
unknown set of thread domains already acquired. The domain retention mechanism
also makes the picture more complex.
</p><p>
To avoid deadlocks, the following general principles are encouraged:
</p><ul>
  <li>Do not acquire a thread domain while holding a lock</li>
  <li>Do not sleep while holding a thread domain</li>
  <li>Use thread domains to prevent concurrent simulation</li>
  <li>Use mutexes to protect specific data structures</li>
</ul>
When needed, it is possible to drop all thread domains,
which is illustrated in the following example:
<pre class="jdocu_small">  domain_lock_t *lock;
  SIM_DROP_THREAD_DOMAINS(&amp;lock);
  /* no thread domains are held here... */
  SIM_REACQUIRE_THREAD_DOMAINS(&amp;lock);
</pre><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Avoid empty drop/reacquire pairs. If the intention is allowing
  other objects to access held domains, then
  <b><i>SIM_yield_thread_domains</i></b> should be used instead. The yield
  function, besides being faster, guarantees that all waiting
  threads are given an opportunity to acquire the held domains.
</div>
<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Thread-Aware-CPUs">2.7.4 Thread-Aware CPUs</a></h2>
<p>

Thread-aware CPUs have a few extra things to consider.
</p><dl><dt id="dt:execution"><b>Execution</b></dt><dd>CPU models are driven from the <b><i>run</i></b> method
    of the <code>execute</code> interface. The method
    is invoked in Threaded Context, with the CPU thread
    domain already held.
<p>
    The thread calling <b><i>run</i></b> is a simulation thread 
    managed by the Simics scheduler. It is possible that this thread
    is used to simulate more than one model.
</p><p>
    The model is not guaranteed that the <b><i>run</i></b> function is always
    invoked by the same thread.
  </p></dd><dt id="dt:signaling"><b>Signaling</b></dt><dd>Whenever another CPU, or a device model, tries to acquire the
    CPU domain, the CPU is notified through the <code>execute_control</code>
    interface.
<p>
    When a CPU is signaled in this way, it should <b>as soon as possible</b>
    call <b><i>SIM_yield_thread_domains</i></b>. The yield function ensures
    that pending direct memory update messages are delivered and allows
    other threads to invoke interfaces on the CPU object.
</p><p>
    The signaling methods are invoked asynchronously, and the implementation
    must not acquire any thread domains or call API functions.
</p><p>
    The signaling only occurs when the CPU's thread domain is the only
    domain held. Acquiring an additional domain, even the already held domain,
    temporarily blocks the signaling mechanism. Due to this, it is
    important that the CPU thread domain is <b>not</b> acquired in the
    <code>run</code> method, since it is already held on entry.
</p><p>
    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
To minimize the waiting time for other threads, it is important
      that the signaling is detected quickly.
    </div></dd><dt id="dt:direct-memory"><b>Direct Memory</b></dt><dd>The methods of the <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface
    are invoked with the CPU thread domain already acquired.
    The model should service requests quickly and without
    acquiring additional thread domains.
  </dd></dl><p>

<p>

Statistics about thread-domain acquisition can be collected with the
<b>enable-object-lock-stats</b> command. This functionality is useful
when a model is optimized to avoid unnecessary thread-domain
crossings or to investigate thread-domain contention.
</p><p>
There is a definite overhead associated with collecting the
statistics; it should not be turned on by default.
</p><p>
The collected statistics can be shown with the
