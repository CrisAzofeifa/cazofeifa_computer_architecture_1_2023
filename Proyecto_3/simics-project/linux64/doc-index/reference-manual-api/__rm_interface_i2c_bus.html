</p><p>

   The <code>i2c_bus</code> interface is implemented by the I2C
   bus. The interface is used by I2C devices to communicate with the
   I2C bus.
</p><p>
   To connect an I2C device to an I2C bus, first you call
   <b><i>register_device</i></b> with a 7-bit <i>address</i> and
   <i>mask</i>. The address is actually an address pattern. When
   there is traffic on the I2C bus (as initiated by a call to the bus
   interface <b><i>start</i></b> function), the target address is matched
   against each registered device by checking if <code>(target_address ^
   device_address) &amp; device_mask == 0</code>.  The
   <i>flags</i> attribute sets the type of connection. The
   alternatives are <code>exclusive</code> or
   <code>shared</code>. An I2C device connected
   <code>exclusive</code> can not share a transfer with another I2C
   device. An I2C device connected <code>shared</code> supports that
   other I2C devices connected <code>shared</code> to the I2C bus
   handles the same transfer. The <b><i>register_device</i></b> function
   returns <code>0</code> on success and <code>-1</code> on failure.
</p><p>
   Use <b><i>unregister_device</i></b> to disconnect an I2C device from
   the I2C bus. To completely remove a device use the same
   <i>address</i> and <i>mask</i> attributes as when the
   device was registered. An I2C device can also remove some part of
   the address match by unregister itself with a different mask.
</p><p>
   An I2C transfer is initiated by a master I2C device. The I2C device
   responding to the transfer is called slave. The master starts a
   transfer by calling the <b><i>start</i></b> function with
   <i>address</i> as argument. The <i>address</i> is the
   7-bit address plus a read/write bit (read/write = 0 →
   slave-receive, read/write = 1 → slave-transmit). The read/write
   bit is the least significant bit. This means that
   all odd values sent to <b><i>start</i></b> function initiates a
   transfer where the master is requesting data from the slave.
   The <b><i>start</i></b> function returns <code>0</code> on success and <code>-1</code>
   on failure.
</p><p>
   An I2C transfer should be terminated by a master I2C device when the bus is
   no longer needed. This is done by calling the <b><i>stop</i></b> function. This
   function always returns <code>0</code>.
</p><p>
   I2C devices implement the <code>i2c_device</code> interface. Both
   the <code>i2c_device</code> interface and the
   <code>i2c_bus</code> interface has identical <b><i>read_data</i></b>
   and <b><i>write_data</i></b> functions to transfer data over the
   bus. The <code>i2c_device</code> also has <b><i>set_state</i></b>
   function, which is used by the I2C bus to set the I2C device
   state. The states are <code>I2C_idle</code>,
   <code>I2C_slave_transmit</code>, and
   <code>I2C_slave_receive</code>. The default state is
   <code>I2C_idle</code>.
</p><p>
   Here are the steps for a transfer:
</p><p>
   <code>1.</code> The I2C master device calls <b><i>start</i></b> in the
    I2C bus with 7-bit address and 1-bit read/write flag.
</p><p>
   <code>2.</code> The I2C bus calls the <b><i>set_state</i></b> in the I2C
   slave device with <code>I2C_slave_transmit</code> or
   <code>I2C_slave_receive</code> as argument depending on the 1-bit
   read/write flag. The I2C slave accepts the state change by
   returning 0.
</p><p>
   <code>3.</code> I2C bus returns <code>0</code> to the I2C master if the
   start command in <code>1</code> was successful. The I2C bus can report
   failure for several reasons, there are another ongoing transfer,
   can not find any device with the address provided, I2C slave did
   not except state change etc.
</p><p>
   <code>4.</code> The I2C master calls the I2C buses
   <b><i>read_data</i></b> or <b><i>write_data</i></b> depending if it
   wants to read from or write to the I2C slave. The I2C bus relays the
   call to the I2C slave <b><i>read_data</i></b> or
   <b><i>write_data</i></b> function. The I2C slave have no way to report
   errors, the I2C master expects the I2C slave to be able to handle
   all calls without any problem. The I2C bus can do step <code>4</code>
   several times before terminating the transfer.
</p><p>
   <code>5.</code> The I2C master calls the <b><i>stop</i></b> function
   when it wants to terminate the transfer. This causes the I2C bus to
   call the <b><i>set_state</i></b> function in the I2C slave with
   <code>I2C_idle</code> as argument. The transfer is now completed.
