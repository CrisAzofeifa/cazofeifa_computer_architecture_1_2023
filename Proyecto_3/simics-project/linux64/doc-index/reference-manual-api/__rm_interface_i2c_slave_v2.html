   The <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface is used together with the <a class="jdocu" href="__rm_interface_i2c_master_v2.html"><code>i2c_master_v2</code></a>
   interface to model communication over an I2C bus. Most calls to a method in
   the <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface expect a response call to a method
   in the <code>i2c_master_v2</code> interface. It is up to each device to
   find the caller's interface; usually it is configured with an attribute in
   both the master and slave device.
</p><p>
   The <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> and <code>i2c_master_v2</code> interfaces
   replace the obsolete interfaces <code>i2c_master</code>,
   <code>i2c_slave</code>, <code>i2c_link</code>, and
   <code>i2c_bridge</code>.
</p><p>
   An I2C bus consists of a number of <em>master</em> devices and a number of
   <em>slave</em> devices.  Each slave device listens to one or more <em>7-bit
   addresses</em> or <em>10-bit addresses</em>.  It is an error to connect two
   slave devices to the same bus if they listen to the same address. 
   Communication over the bus is initiated by a master, which can communicate
   with one slave device at a time.  Only one master on a bus can communicate
   at a time.
</p><p>
   Two I2C devices can communicate directly if one implements the
   <code>i2c_master_v2</code> interface and the other one implements the
   <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface.  An I2C bus with multiple masters or
   slaves is typically modeled using an <b>i2c-link-v2</b> object,
   where each device is connected to an endpoint object.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>start</i></b> method starts a transfer.  The
   <i>address</i> parameter is the address of the slave device, encoded
   as an 8-bit number.  To communicate with 7-bit address slave device, using 
   little-endian bit numbering, bit 0 is a read/write bit (0 → master
   writes, 1 → master reads) and bits 1 to 7 is the 7-bit address of
   the slave device.  The <i>address</i> parameter should normally
   be in the (inclusive) range <code>0x10 - 0xef</code>; the ranges <code>0x00 -
   0x0f</code> and <code>0xf0 - 0xff</code> are reserved for special addressing modes.
   To communicate with 10-bit address slave device, using little-endian bit 
   numbering, bit 0 is a read/write bit (same as 7-bit address), bits 1 to 2
   is part of 10-bit address, and bits 3 to 7 is 10-bit address mode 0b11110.
</p><p>
   The slave responds to <b><i>start</i></b> using the
   <b><i>acknowledge</i></b> method.  The <i>ack</i> parameter may be
   <code>I2C_ack</code> or <code>I2C_noack</code> if the start is acked
   or noacked, respectively. In a multi-master configuration, the slave may
   instead respond by calling the <b><i>start</i></b> method in the
   <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface of the master device; this signals
   that the master lost the bus arbitration. This is discussed further below.
</p><p>
   If a start was acked by a slave device, read/write bit in the
   <b><i>start</i></b> method was 1, the master proceeds with a sequence
   of <b><i>read</i></b> calls.  Each call is followed by a
   <b><i>read_response</i></b> call from the slave.  If the read/write bit in
   the <b><i>start</i></b> was 0, the master instead proceeds with a
   sequence of <b><i>write</i></b> calls, each one followed by an
   <b><i>acknowledge</i></b> call. The <i>ack</i> parameter of the
   <b><i>acknowledge</i></b> method may be either <code>I2C_ack</code> or
   <code>I2C_noack</code>, representing ack and noack, respectively.
</p><p>
   After sending a number of reads or writes, the master may choose to
   either call the <b><i>stop</i></b> method to issue a <em>stop condition</em>
   which terminates the transfer, or to call the <b><i>start</i></b>
   method again to issue a <em>repeated start condition</em>.  The repeated
   start condition works like a normal start condition.
</p><p>
   When 0 is passed as the <i>address</i> parameter of the
   <b><i>start</i></b> method, a <em>General Call</em> transfer is initiated. A
   General Call transfer works like a normal write transfer, except that
   multiple slave devices may acknowledge the start and write requests.  The
   master will conceive a request as acknowledged if it was acknowledged by at
   least one of the slaves.
</p><p>
   When 10-bit address pattern is passed as the <i>address</i>
   parameter of the <b><i>start</i></b> method, a <em>10-bit address</em>
   transaction is initiated. A 10-bit address transaction begins with write
   status (read/write bit should be 0). As mentioned before, bits 1 to 2 are
   the most significant bits of 10-bit address. Then following is a call
   to the <b><i>write</i></b> method with the last 8 bits of 10-bit address.
   If the transaction is slave-receiver, the next transfer works like a
   normal write transfer. If the transaction is slave-transmitter, then
   the <b><i>start</i></b> method is called again with the same address pattern
   as before, but with bit 0 (the read/write bit) set to 1. This is followed
   by calls to <b><i>read</i></b> like in a normal read transaction.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>addresses</i></b> method is used to retrieve the set of addresses a
   device currently listens to.  The method is called by the
   <b>i2c-link-v2</b> to provide an overview of the bus topology, and
   to detect address collisions early.  The method may not have any
   side-effects on the simulation.  The return value is a list containing all
   the different values of the <i>address</i> parameter in a
   <b><i>start</i></b> call that the slave would respond to with
   <code>I2C_ack</code>.  The list may also contain an element
   <code>Nil</code> to mark that the device might respond to other addresses as
   well.  If a device is configured to listen to a specific address but is
   currently disabled, then that address may still be included in the list.
</p><p>
   For example, if a slave device listens to the single 7-bit address
   <code>0x55</code>, the return value of <b><i>addresses</i></b> would be
   <code>[0xaa, 0xab]</code>, using Python list syntax.
</p><p>
   The specification of the return value may be extended in the future, to
   allow other values than <code>Nil</code> and 8-bit integers. Therefore, callers
   should not make any assumptions on how the elements are formatted in the
   return value.
</p><p>
   For most I2C devices it is sufficient to implement only one of the
   <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> and <code>i2c_master_v2</code> interfaces.  In
   some cases it may be useful for a device to implement both interfaces,
   either because the device can act both as a master and as a slave on the
   bus, or because it needs to use the <b><i>start</i></b> and
   <b><i>stop</i></b> methods to monitor start and stop conditions on the bus.
   I2C link endpoints also implement both interfaces.
</p><p>
   If multiple master devices are connected to the same i2c link, then all
   master devices need to implement the <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface
   in addition to <code>i2c_master_v2</code>, in order to handle bus
   arbitration correctly:
</p><p>
   </p><ul>
     <li>A master device should monitor calls to the <b><i>start</i></b> and
     <b><i>stop</i></b> functions: After a call to <b><i>start</i></b> in a master
     device, the master should not call <b><i>start</i></b> in the slave until
     after a subsequent call to <b><i>stop</i></b> in the master.</li>

     <li>When a master calls <b><i>start</i></b> in a link endpoint device, the
     endpoint may respond with a call to <b><i>start</i></b> instead of
     <b><i>acknowledge</i></b>; this means that there was bus arbitration, which
     the master lost to the given <b><i>start</i></b> request.  Note that this
     case can not happen on a latency-free connection, since all arbitration is
     handled by the master's monitoring of <b><i>start</i></b> and <b><i>stop</i></b>
     calls. Note also that user-written slave devices are required to respond
     with <b><i>acknowledge</i></b> to a <b><i>start</i></b> call; only the i2c link
     endpoint (and other i2c infrastructure objects from the Simics-Base
     package) are allowed to respond with a <b><i>start</i></b> call.</li>
   </ul>
<p>
   Note that there is no need for a master device to implement the
   <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface if the device only will be used in
   single-master configurations.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>start</i></b>, <b><i>write</i></b> and <b><i>read</i></b> methods in the
   <code>i2c_slave_v2</code> interface are allowed to respond synchronously;
   i.e., the <b><i>acknowledge</i></b> or <b><i>read_response</i></b> method may be
   called before the corresponding method in the slave interface has returned.
   A master that needs to connect directly to a slave device needs to take this
   into consideration; however, when communicating via an
   <b>i2c-link-v2</b> object, the link guarantees that all responses
   are asynchronous.
