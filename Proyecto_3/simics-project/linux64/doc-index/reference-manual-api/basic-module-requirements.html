To use multi-threading in Simics, all modules used in the
simulation must be thread safe. This section describes what it means
for a module to be thread safe, and what conditions must be fulfilled.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
In this section, thread safe is used in the sense that models
  instantiated in different cells can be simulated
  concurrently without issues. This is a weaker definition than normally used.
</div>Simics checks each module it loads to see if it has been marked as
safe. A module is thread safe if it fulfills the following conditions:
<p>
</p><ul>
  <li>It must run without execution context violations.</li>
  <li>The module makefile variable <i>THREAD_SAFE</i> must be set to
    <code>yes</code> when compiling the module.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Below is an example makefile for a module marked as thread safe.
It can be found in the
<code></code><em>[project]</em><code>/modules/sample-user-decoder</code> directory
if the <b>sample-user-decoder</b> has been copied to the
project.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">MODULE_CLASSES = sample-user-decoder

SRC_FILES = sample-user-decoder.c

SIMICS_API := 6
THREAD_SAFE = yes

include $(MODULE_MAKEFILE)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To make a module thread safe, global state should be avoided, both in
the form of global variables and in the form of local static
variables in C. Having constant global variables are fine. Modules written
in pure DML do not have this problem since the DML compiler
does not emit any non-constant global state.
</p><p>
Simics checks for some execution context violations during
run-time and emits warnings if they occur. When running
with multi-threading disabled, violations result in warnings that can
optionally be turned off. With multi-threading enabled,
violations cause hard errors.
</p><p>
If a module that is not marked with <code>THREAD_SAFE=yes</code> is
loaded, multi-threading will be turned off automatically and a warning
will be shown. The <b>list-modules</b> command will show whether a
module is marked thread safe or not.
