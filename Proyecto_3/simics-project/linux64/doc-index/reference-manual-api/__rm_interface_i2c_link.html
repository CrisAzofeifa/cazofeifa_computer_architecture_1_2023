#define I2C_LINK_INTERFACE "i2c_link"
</pre><p>
</p><p>

   The <code>i2c_link</code> interface is implemented by the I2C
   link. The interface is used by I2C devices to communicate with the
   I2C link.
</p><p>
   An I2C device implements either the <code>i2c_slave</code> or the
   <code>i2c_master</code> interface, or both. You don't need to do
   anything to connect an I2C master device to a link.
</p><p>
   To connect an I2C slave device to an I2C link, call
   <b><i>register_slave_address</i></b> with an <em>address pattern</em>
   consisting of the <i>address</i> and <i>mask</i>
   parameters. When there is traffic on the I2C link (as initiated by a
   call to the link interface <b><i>start_request</i></b> function), the
   target address is matched against each registered device by
   checking if <code>(target_address ^ device_address) &amp; device_mask
   == 0</code>; i.e., the bits that are set to 1 in the mask indicates
   which bits in the address that must match.
</p><p>
   There are three different <em>addressing modes</em> defined by this
   protocol: <em>7-bit addressing</em>, <em>General call</em>, and
   <em>10-bit addressing</em>. 7-bit addressing is by far the most
   common addressing mode, and at the moment the only one supported by
   the official <code>i2c_link</code> device. When 7-bit addressing is
   used, the address fits into the lower 8 bits of the
   <i>address</i> parameter; in other addressing modes more
   than 8 bits can be used, but the addressing mode can always be
   deduced from the lower 8 address bits.
</p><p>
   In 7-bit addressing mode, the address of an I2C device is encoded
   as an even 8-bit number, in the range <code>0x10</code> -
   <code>0xef</code>.  In other words, address ranges <code>0x00</code> -
   <code>0x0f</code> and <code>0xf0</code> - <code>0xff</code> are reserved for
   other addressing modes, and the 7-bit address is defined by bits 7
   to 1 (little-endian) of the 8-bit encoded address. Bit 0 is reserved as a
   read/write bit for the <b><i>start_request</i></b> function, and
   should be 0 in both <i>address</i> and 0 in
   <i>mask</i>, while bits 8 to 31 should be 0 in
   <i>address</i> and 1 in <i>mask</i>.
</p><p>
   It is an error to register two I2C slave devices to the same 7-bit
   address.
</p><p>
   Use <b><i>disconnect_device</i></b> to completely disconnect an I2C
   slave device from the I2C link. If you just intend to disable
   the I2C functionality of the device (without disconnecting the
   wire), use <b><i>unregister_slave_address</i></b>, and use the same
   <i>address</i> and <i>mask</i> attributes as when
   the device was registered. An I2C slave device can also remove
   some part of the address match by unregistering itself with a
   different mask.
</p><p>
   An I2C transfer is initiated by a master I2C device. The I2C device
   responding to the transfer is called slave. The master starts a
   transfer by calling the <b><i>start_request</i></b> function with
   <i>address</i> as argument. In 7-bit addressing mode, the
   <i>address</i> is the 7-bit address plus a read-write bit
   (read-write = 0 → slave-receive, read-write = 1 →
   slave-transmit). The read-write bit is the least significant
   bit. This means that all odd values sent to <b><i>start</i></b>
   function initiates a transfer where the master is requesting data
   from the slave.
</p><p>
   I2C slave devices implement the <code>i2c_slave</code>
   interface. The <code>i2c_slave</code> interface and the
   <code>i2c_link</code> interface have identical
   <b><i>start_request</i></b>, <b><i>read_request</i></b>,
   <b><i>ack_read_request</i></b> and <b><i>write_request</i></b> functions
   to transfer data over the link. See the <code>i2c_slave</code>
   interface for the definitions of these functions.
</p><p>
   I2C master devices implement the <code>i2c_master</code>
   interface, which has the functions <b><i>start_response</i></b>,
   <b><i>read_response</i></b>, <b><i>ack_read_response</i></b> and
   <b><i>write_response</i></b> in common with the
   <code>i2c_link</code> interface. The only difference in
   definition is that the <i>I2C_status_bus_busy</i> value is not
   allowed for the <i>status</i> parameter of
   <code>start_response</code> in the <code>i2c_link</code>
   interface, while it is allowed in the <code>i2c_master</code>
   interface. The definitions of these functions can be found in the
   documentation of the <code>i2c_master</code> interface.
</p><p>
   Here are the steps for a transfer:
</p><p>
   </p><ol>
     <li>The I2C master device calls <b><i>start_request</i></b> in
     the I2C link with 7-bit address and 1-bit read/write flag.
     </li>

     <li>The I2C link calls <b><i>start_request</i></b> in the I2C slave
     device, forwarding the address given by the master. If there is
     no slave device on the given address, or if the link is busy with
     another connection, the I2C link instead terminates the connection
     by calling <b><i>start_response</i></b> in the master device with
     <i>I2C_status_noack</i> or <i>I2C_status_bus_busy</i>
     as status code.
     </li>

     <li>The I2C slave device calls <b><i>start_response</i></b> in
     the I2C link, with either <i>I2C_status_success</i> or
     <i>I2C_status_noack</i> as status code.
     </li>

     <li>The I2C link calls <b><i>start_response</i></b> in the I2C
     master device. This terminates the transfer if the status wasn't
     <i>I2C_status_success</i>.
     </li>

     <li>The I2C master calls the <b><i>read_request</i></b> or
     <b><i>write_request</i></b> function in the I2C link, depending on
     the read/write bit given in the start_request message. The I2C
     link relays the call to the I2C slave <b><i>read_request</i></b> or
     <b><i>write_request</i></b> function. The slave responds with a call
     to <b><i>read_response</i></b> or <b><i>write_response</i></b>, which
     the link relays to the I2C master device.  If it's a read
     transfer, the master calls the <b><i>ack_read_request</i></b>
     function in the I2C link, which is relayed to the slave. The
     slave responds with a call to the <b><i>ack_read_response</i></b> in
     the I2C link, which is relayed to the master.  This step can be
     repeated any number of times.
     </li>

     <li> The I2C master ends the transfer either by calling
     <b><i>start_request</i></b> again (possibly with a different slave
     address), or by calling <b><i>stop</i></b> in the I2C link. The link
     will respond by calling <b><i>stop</i></b> in the slave device (if
     it wasn't a repeated start with the same device as slave), and if
     it was a start command, relay it to the slave device as in step 2
     above.  Before a master device is allowed to call
     <b><i>start_request</i></b> or <b><i>stop</i></b>, it must wait for any
     pending <b><i>read_response</i></b> or <b><i>write_response</i></b>
     call from a slave device.  In a read transfer, the last call to
     the function <b><i>ack_read_request</i></b> should pass
     <i>I2C_status_noack</i> in the <i>ack</i> parameter.
     </li>
   </ol>
<p>
   In total, an I2C link can be in nine different states:
</p><p>
   </p><ol>

     <li>Idle, waiting for <b><i>start_request</i></b> call from any master
     device</li>

     <li>Waiting for a <b><i>start_response</i></b> call from the slave
     device (write mode)</li>

     <li>Waiting for a <b><i>write_request</i></b> (or <b><i>stop</i></b> or
     repeated <b><i>start_request</i></b>) call from the current master
     device</li>

     <li>Waiting for a <b><i>write_response</i></b> call from the slave
     device</li>

     <li>Waiting for <b><i>start_response</i></b> call from the slave
     device (read mode)</li>

     <li>Waiting for a <b><i>read_request</i></b> (or <b><i>stop</i></b> or
     repeated <b><i>start_request</i></b>) call from the current master
     device</li>

     <li>Waiting for a <b><i>read_response</i></b> call from the slave
     device</li>

     <li>Waiting for an <b><i>ack_read_request</i></b> call from the
     current master device</li>

     <li>Waiting for an <b><i>ack_read_response</i></b> call from the slave
     device</li>
   </ol>
<p>
   During a transfer, the actual data is delivered by the
   <b><i>write_request</i></b> and <b><i>read_response</i></b> function
   calls. The data is always delivered one byte at a time.
</p><p>
   There are two addressing modes apart from the 7-bit addressing mode
   described above:
</p><p>
   </p><ul>

     <li>General call address: This is a kind of broadcast signal; an
     I2C master device writes data to the link, that any I2C device
     can listen to. A General call is issued by calling
     <b><i>request_start</i></b> with <i>address</i> = 0. To
     listen to General call, call <b><i>register_slave_address</i></b>
     with <i>addr</i> = <code>0</code> and <i>mask</i> =
     <code>0xffffffff</code>. Multiple slave devices can register to the
     General call address; calls to <b><i>start_request</i></b> and
     <b><i>write_request</i></b> will be relayed to each registered slave
     device. The <b><i>start_response</i></b> and
     <b><i>write_response</i></b> functions in the calling master's
     <code>i2c_master</code> interface will be called when
     <em>all</em> slave devices have called the corresponding function
     in the <code>i2c_link</code> interface.</li>

     <li>10-bit addresses: This is an extension to the protocol, where
     two bytes are sent as address, of which 10 bits are interpreted
     as address bits. The address sent to
     <b><i>register_slave_address</i></b> consists of the two bytes that
     are sent, with the first sent byte as the least significant
     byte. This means that the bits of the <i>address</i>
     parameter are defined as follows:
<p>
     </p><ul>
       <li>Bit 0 = 0</li>
       <li>Bits 1-2 correspond to bits 8-9 of the 10-bit address.</li>
       <li>Bits 3 = 0</li>
       <li>Bits 4-7 = all 1</li>
       <li>Bits 8-15 correspond to bits 0-7 of the 10-bit address.</li>
       <li>Bits 16-31 = all 0</li>
     </ul>
<p>
     Similarly, the <i>mask</i> parameter should have bit 0
     set to 0 and bits 3-7 and 16-31 set to 1.
</p><p>
     A transmission from a master to a 10-bit addressed slave must
     start with a write transaction, which optionally is followed by a
     read transaction from the same slave. The write transaction is
     started by a <b><i>start_request</i></b> call, whose
     <i>address</i> parameter is a 16-bit number, composed in
     the same way as the <i>address</i> parameter of
     <b><i>register_slave_address</i></b> described above, with bit 0 set
     to 0. After writing the desired number of bytes, a repeated start
     command can be issued to start the read transaction to the same
     slave device. The repeated start command is issued by calling
     <b><i>start_request</i></b>, now with an 8-bit
     <i>address</i> parameter, which consists of the lower 8
     bits from the <i>address</i> parameter of the previous
     <b><i>start_request</i></b> call, with bit 0 flipped to 1.  </p></li>

     It is an error to register two I2C slave devices to the same
     10-bit address.
   </ul>
<p>
   Note that a single call to <b><i>register_slave_address</i></b> may
   only register addresses from <em>one</em> addressing mode; it is an
   error to supply an address pattern that matches addresses from
   different addressing modes.
</p><p>
   During write operations, ACK bits are sent in the
   <i>status</i> parameter of the <b><i>write_response</i></b>
   functions. During read operations, the master device sends the ACK
   bit with the <b><i>ack_read_request</i></b> function after the
   <b><i>read_response</i></b> function has been called by the slave. The
   slave should respond with a call to the
   <b><i>ack_read_response</i></b> function, which is relayed to the
   master.  The value of the ACK bit controls which functions that are
   allowed as the next operation by the master device: If the ACK bit
   is <code>0</code> (i.e., <code>I2C_status_success</code>), the next
   operation must be a <b><i>read_request</i></b>, while ACK = <code>1</code>
   (<code>I2C_status_noack</code>) means that the next operation
   must be <b><i>stop</i></b> or a repeated <b><i>start_request</i></b>. It
   is an error to violate this rule: If the master device's software
   attempts to issue a STOP or START condition after a read with
   ACK=0, the master device should catch the error and log a
   <code>spec_violation</code> message.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_bridge</i></b> function is used to register a
   device that implements the <code>i2c_bridge</code> interface. The
   I2C link device will use the <code>i2c_bridge</code> interface to
   keep the I2C bridge device updated with which slave addresses on
   the link that have something registered on them; this is mainly
   useful when implementing a bridge between i2c links. For more
   information, see the documentation on the <a class="jdocu" href="__rm_interface_i2c_bridge.html">i2c_bridge</a> interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>disconnect_device</i></b> function completely disconnects a
   device (slave, master, bridge or any combination thereof) from the
   link. The link checks which i2c interfaces the device implements, and
   cleanly removes all its references to the device. This mainly has
   following effects:
</p><p>
   </p><ul>
     <li>The link is prevented from issuing pending
     <b><i>response</i></b>-like calls to a disconnected master or
     bridge device</li>

     <li>If the device is currently involved in a data transfer, the
     transfer will be aborted as cleanly as possible.</li>

     <li>If the device was registered with the <b><i>register_bridge</i></b>
     function, its <b><i>address_removed</i></b> function is called for each
     currently registered i2c slave address.</li>

     <li>The disconnected device is erased from any internal caches;
     this prevents certain memory corruption errors which can occur
     if one device is destroyed and another one is created on exactly
     the same memory location.</li>
   </ul>
<p>
   Hence, <b><i>disconnect_device</i></b> an I2C device which has had any
   kind of interaction with an I2C link, must always use
   <b><i>disconnect_device</i></b> when disconnecting.
