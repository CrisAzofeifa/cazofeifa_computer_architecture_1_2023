<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">The <code>usb_device_interface_t</code> interface is implemented
   by all USB devices. It is used by the USB host to communicate with
   the USB devices.  The interface is Simics internal, and may be
   changed in future versions of Simics.  It should not be used by
   user-defined classes.
<p>
   The <b><i>submit_transfer()</i></b> function is used by the USB host controller
   to send a new transfer to a USB device. Transfers are the basic means of
   communication between the USB host controller and the USB devices. A
   transfer contains all information needed to handle control, bulk, interrupt,
   and isochronous transfers. A transfer to a USB device simply moves the
   control from the USB host to the USB device. The USB device can then
   decide when to send back any useful data to the USB host.  The USB device
   receives a pointer to the transfer to handle. It can either handle the
   transfer immediately or send the transfer back later using the
   <b><i>complete_transfer()</i></b> function in the
   <code>usb_interface_t</code> interface, which is implemented by the USB
   host.
</p><p>
   The USB device must return <code>USB_Transfer_Completed</code> when it
   handles the transfer immediately, i.e., it has filled the required fields in
   the transfer structure. The USB device must return
   <code>USB_Transfer_Not_Ready</code> for unfinished transfers, i.e., the
   USB device does not have any interesting data to deliver at this point. The
   isochronous and interrupt transfers contain a field indicating how long time
   the USB host expects the USB device to wait before returning the
   transfer. Note that it is just an indication on how often this transfer is
   scheduled in the periodic list and USB devices can complete the transfers at
   any time. A value of <code>0</code> means that the USB host does have any
   expectations about the return time.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>abort_transfer()</i></b> function tells the USB device to abort a
   transfer previously issued by the USB host. The USB device should not call
   the <b><i>complete_transfer()</i></b> function for a request that has been
   aborted.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>reset()</i></b> function is used by the USB host to reset the USB
   device.
</p><p>
   The USB host expects the device to return the same transfer pointer it
   received when completing, i.e., the transfer pointer is used to identify
   uniquely a transfer.
