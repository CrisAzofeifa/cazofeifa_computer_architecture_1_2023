<a name="cell"></a>
</p><p>
A cell is a group of configuration objects which may interact
with each other through direct function calls.
If a model needs to communicate with objects in other cells during the
simulation, it needs to do this through links (see section <a class="reference" href="#Link-Objects">2.3.4</a> or the <em>Link Library Programming Guide</em>). A link always
introduces a delay in the communication, which means that messages
cannot be sent and received in the same cycle.
</p><p>
In a configuration, a cell is represented by a configuration object of
class <b>cell</b>. All objects that implement the <code>cycle</code>
interface (referred to as clocks) automatically have a <i>cell</i>
attribute that will point to the cell they belong to. Since all Simics objects
have a <i>queue</i> attribute pointing at a clock object, they will by
extension belong to the cell of their clock object. This is illustrated
in the figure below:
</p><div class="figure" id="cell_partitioning">

<div style="text-align: center">
<img alt="" src="cell.png">
<div class="caption">Figure 3. Configuration is partitioned into cells</div>
</div>
</div>

<br>Another example is the following configuration:
<pre class="jdocu_small">OBJECT cell0 TYPE cell {
}
OBJECT cell1 TYPE cell {
}
OBJECT cpu0 TYPE cpu {
       cell: cell0
}
OBJECT cpu1 TYPE cpu {
       cell: cell0
}
OBJECT cpu2 TYPE cpu {
       cell: cell1
}
OBJECT device0 TYPE device {
       queue = cpu0
}
OBJECT device1 TYPE device {
       queue = cpu0
}
OBJECT device2 TYPE device {
       queue = cpu2
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
In this example, <b>device0</b> has <b>cpu0</b> as a queue, and thus
belongs to <b>cell0</b>, while <b>device2</b>
has <b>cpu2</b> as a queue, and thus belongs to <b>cell1</b>.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Cells-and-Components">2.3.1 Cells and Components</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics provides an
automatic cell partitioning based on top-level components. Each
component object implements a <b><i><a name="create_cell">create_cell</a>()</i></b>
method that can
return <code>True</code> or <code>False</code> to the question:
should a simulation cell be created to contain this component and all
its sub-components? By default, top-level components return 
<code>True</code> and all other components return <code>False</code>. 
By overriding this method, it is possible to 
automatically create cells at lower levels in the component hierarchy,
or to disable cell creation altogether. In the latter case, the
<b><i>create_cell()</i></b> should return <code>False</code> and the 
components should define cell objects themselves and assign clocks to
them as appropriate, just as normal configuration objects.
</p><p>
The code snippets below show how to overload
the <b><i>create_cell()</i></b> function for both old-style and hierarchical
way of writing components.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">class mycomp(component_object):
    ...
    def create_cell(self):
        return False

class mycomp(StandardConnectorComponent): # or StandardComponent
    ....
    class component(comp.StandardComponent.component):
        def create_cell(self):
            return False
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Cells can also be created independently of components, by
creating <b>cell</b> objects and setting the <i>cell</i>
attribute of the clock objects which should belong to the cell.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Compatibility">2.3.2 Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
If clock objects are created that do not point to a cell, then
a <b>default_cell</b> object will be created, unless it exists already,
to make sure these clock objects are scheduled as intended.
This is a simple compatibility mechanism for use with older scripts.
If you are building your configurations in several steps, but without
using components, you will have to introduce your own cells and configure them.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Verifying-the-Cell-Partitioning">2.3.3 Verifying the Cell Partitioning</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The <b>check-cell-partitioning</b> command checks
either a checkpoint or the currently loaded configuration for
violations of the cell partitioning rulesâ€”namely, that
objects belonging to one cell do not have any references to
objects in another cell. Such references will be shown
in the form of a chain of attributes connecting the cells.
</p><p>
An object is considered to belong to a cell if either it is a cell
object, or if it refers to or is referred to by an object belonging to
that cell. Object references are object values in (checkpointed)
attributes.
</p><p>
False positives can be suppressed by defining the attribute
<i>outside_cell</i> and setting it to true for objects
that should not be considered part of any cell but still refer
to other objects in cells. This can be necessary for objects
that only use these references in safe ways, e.g., in Global Context.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Link-Objects">2.3.4 Links</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Links are the only Simics objects that should connect different cells
together. In other words, link components are allowed to connect to
device components
belonging to different cells without breaking the cell isolation rules. This
works because all communication over the links are asynchronous with a delay
that is constrained by the synchronization parameters so that the information
exchange never becomes indeterministic.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
While it is possible to perform cross-cell calls if special
  precautions are taken, it should be avoided since it likely prevents the
  simulation from being deterministic even when the simulation is
  running in the "serial" threading mode.
</div>
<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Synchronization-domains">2.3.5 Synchronization domains</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
All cells are connected to a <em><a name="synchronization-domain">synchronization domain</a></em> that
controls the execution in the cells to ensure that they do not run too
far apart in virtual time. The domain has a <i>min_latency</i>
parameter that limits the allowed difference in time between clocks in
all the cells connected to it. This works as a lower limit for the
latency that link objects can use when communicating between cells.
