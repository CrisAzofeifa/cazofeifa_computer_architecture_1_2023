<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">The <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface must be implemented by
   memory-user objects that use the <code>direct_memory</code> interface.
<p>
   The <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface replaces the
   <code>memory_page_update</code> interface from Simics 4.8.
</p><p>
   Accesses to memory are controlled by a handle that the memory-user object
   requests by calling the <b><i>get_handle</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface. The object implementing the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface through which the handle was
   established is passed to the functions in
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> as <i>target</i>.
</p><p>
   If the <b><i>release</i></b> method is called, the corresponding
   <i>handle</i> and all the permissions and inhibit protections are
   recalled. The memory-user object must stop using the handle and
   associated data pointers and then call the acknowledge method
   <b><i>ack</i></b> in the <code>direct_memory</code> interface from
   which the handle was granted.
</p><p>
   A call to the <b><i>update_permission</i></b> method revokes earlier requested
   rights for a handle. The <i>lost_access</i> argument recalls rights to
   use the handle for the given access bits. This means that the handle needs
   to be re-fetched (by a call to the <b><i>lookup</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface followed by a call to the
   <b><i>get_handle</i></b> method of the <code>direct_memory</code> interface)
   before the handle can be used again for the particular access. This typically
   happens if a new breakpoint is inserted or a remap of the memory system is
   done. In case of a remap it is possible that the same handle will never be
   returned again which means that any user data associated with the handle
   should be reclaimed. 
</p><p>
   The <i>lost_permission</i> and the <i>lost_inhibit</i> arguments
   describe which permission rights and inhibit protection that are
   revoked. However, in contrast to the <i>lost_access</i>, the
   <i>handle</i> is still valid and can be used to re-request permission
   rights and inhibit protection.
</p><p>
   A call to the <b><i>conflicting_access</i></b> method informs a memory-user
   object that a conflicting memory operation will be performed. Hence, if the
   memory-user object have some protected representation of memory (such as
   decoded instructions in an internal cache), that representation of memory
   has to be flushed (or written back to memory in case of dirty data). Note
   however that the memory-user object does not lose any permission rights or
   any inhibit protection. 
</p><p>
   There is no mechanism for locking simulated memory in host memory.
</p><p>
   All methods in this interface receive a <code>direct_memory_ack_id_t</code>
   value as an argument. The <b><i>ack</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface must be called with this
   <i>id</i> as an argument when the corresponding operation has been
   carried out. The <b><i>ack</i></b> method may be called after the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface function has returned, which
   allows for queueing of update requests. This may be valuable if multiple
   simulator threads are used.
</p><p>
   An exception to the allowed queueing of update requests is for update
   requests that are received while calling <b><i>request</i></b> in the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface. Such requests must be handled
   immediately with <b><i>ack</i></b> being called before the return of the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface function. This requirement
   avoids a dead-lock that would otherwise happen if <b><i>request</i></b> would
   wait for <b><i>ack</i></b> before returning, but <b><i>ack</i></b> is
   queued to be handled at some time after <b><i>request</i></b> has returned.
