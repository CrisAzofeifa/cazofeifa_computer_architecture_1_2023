<p>
   The <code>direct_memory</code> interface is implemented by objects that
   model memory, such as RAM and ROM objects. These are called direct-memory
   objects. A user of the interface is called a memory user and is
   typically a processor that wants to do fast accesses to memory. The
   direct-memory object corresponding to a particular physical address
   can be obtained using the <b><i>lookup</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface.
   See the documentation for the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface for more information.
</p><p>
   A memory user using the <code>direct_memory</code> interface 
   must implement the <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_handle</i></b> method is used by a memory user
   to create or retrieve a handle to the memory region starting
   at offset <i>offs</i> with size <i>size</i>.
   The handle is typically used later on to request access permissions
   and to retrieve a direct pointer to the region.
   The handle returned by <b><i>get_handle</i></b> is private to the
   memory user specified in the <i>requester</i> parameter.
</p><p>
   If <b><i>get_handle</i></b> is invoked multiple times for the same
   range, and with identical <i>requester</i> and
   <i>subsystem</i> arguments, then the same handle will
   be returned each time, assuming the original handle is still valid.
   Note that the original handle is only returned if the range
   matches exactly. A single memory user can obtain multiple
   distinct handles for the same memory range by using different values for the
   <i>subsystem</i> parameter.
</p><p>
   For RAM and ROM, <i>offs</i> and <i>size</i> must
   specify a region which does not intersect a naturally aligned
   8192 byte boundary, or the request will fail with a NULL return
   value. Other direct-memory objects might have different requirements.   
</p><p>
   The <b><i>request</i></b> method is used to request a host pointer to simulated
   memory. This pointer can be used to carry out fast memory operations without
   having to involve the Simics API. The <i>handle</i> argument is the
   handle obtained using <b><i>get_handle</i></b>.
</p><p>
   Both the <i>permission</i> argument and the <i>inhibit</i> argument
   are <code>access_t</code> type bit fields. The <i>permission</i>
   argument is used to specify what kind of memory operations the memory user
   will perform. For example, if a memory user wants to read memory, the
   <i>permission</i> argument must include the Sim_Access_Read value.  The
   <i>inhibit</i> argument specifies what other memory users are not
   allowed to do. For example, if <i>inhibit</i> is set to Sim_Access_Write
   other memory users are not allowed to write to the memory range.  This
   protection mechanism can be used to create caches of simulated memory,
   request exclusive permissions to a memory range in order to carry out atomic
   operations, and similar.  When a memory user is requesting permission to a
   memory range that another memory user has protected with conflicting inhibit
   bits, the direct-memory object will inform the other memory user of
   the lost permissions and protection through the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.  A user can lose both the
   permission and protection for a memory range in this way. When this happens,
   a memory user may re-request permissions and inhibit protection.
</p><p>
   Note: if a memory user has multiple handles which overlaps, then
   each handle is considered to be a distinct memory user. For example,
   if a memory user holds two handles, and requests write inhibit on
   one of them, then write permission will be revoked from the second
   handle (if such permission had been granted).
</p><p>
   The <b><i>request</i></b> method returns a <code>direct_memory_t</code> value
   with information about the retrieved permissions and inhibit bits. These
   bits can be a super set of the bits that actually was requested. The
   returned data pointer can be used to access the memory range. Accesses are
   valid from the data pointer and up to the end of the range, i.e., addresses
   up to data pointer + <i>size</i> - 1, where size is the size valid for
   the handle. A call to <b><i>request</i></b> always succeeds and the
   corresponding memory range is valid until the permissions or the handle are
   revoked by the <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.  Note that the
   data pointer may change each time <b><i>request</i></b> is called (with the
   same handle) since Simics may move simulated memory. If the pointer
   changes, then the old pointer must not be used.
</p><p>
   With <b><i>set_user_data</i></b>, a memory user can associate 
   a user-defined pointer with a specific handle. The pointer can
   be retrieved using the <b><i>get_user_data</i></b> method, which takes
   a <i>handle</i> as an argument.
</p><p>
   A memory user can use the <b><i>release</i></b> function to notify the
   direct-memory object when it is no longer interested in the memory
   region corresponding to <i>handle</i>. The handle is invalid
   and must not be used for anything after being released.
   </p><p>
   The <b><i>ack</i></b> method is used by a memory user to inform the 
   direct-memory object that it has given up the corresponding permission and
   inhibit rights for a memory range when called by a method in the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.
</p><p>
   Permissions can be revoked from all memory users by invoking the
   <b><i>revoke</i></b> method. The <i>permission</i> parameter
   specifies the permissions which will be revoked from all memory users.
   Similarly, <i>inhibit</i> specifies the inhibit privileges which
   will be revoked. For instance, calling <b><i>revoke</i></b> with
   <i>permission</i>
   set to <code>Sim_Access_Write</code> will ensure that nobody has
   write permissions to the direct-memory object.
