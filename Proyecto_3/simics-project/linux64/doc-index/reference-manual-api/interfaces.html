</p><p>
This section lists the interfaces that can be implemented by the
processor model to enable certain Simics features. They are not required,
but implementing them will allow user defined processor models to
support the same generic feature set as Simics standard processor
models. If you intend to plug your model into an existing
Simics-provided platform, then many of these interfaces are actually
required for such a platform to function.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Processor-Info-Interface">Processor Info Interface</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="processor_info"></a>
<a name="processor_info_v2"></a>
The <code>processor_info_v2</code> interface is implemented by
   processors models. The interface has processor generic functions
   that are architecture independent.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>disassemble</i></b> function returns the disassemble string for an
   instruction at <i>address</i> with opcode according to
   <i>instruction_data</i>. The <i>instruction_data</i> is an
   <em>attr_value_t</em> value of <em>data</em> type with the bytes of the
   opcode. The bytes are in the same order as they are stored in memory. For
   VLIW architectures, <i>sub_operation</i> is used to select which
   sub-operation to disassemble. The sub-operations start at zero, and a
   request for the entire unit including all sub-operations is encoded with
   sub-operation -1. A request for a sub-operation that is not present (for
   example when <i>sub-operation</i> is neither 0 nor -1 for non-VLIW
   architectures) results in the integer part of the return tuple being set to
   zero. If successful, the function should return a tuple with the size of the
   instruction in bytes and the disassembly string. The disassembly string
   should be allocated with MM_MALLOC or similar and is to be freed by the
   caller. If more bytes are needed, then the function should indicate that by
   returning a negative number in the tuple where the absolute value of the
   number is the required number of bytes. The string should be NULL if more
   bytes are needed. The implementor of <code>processor_info_v2</code> is
   allowed to request one additional byte at a time until enough bytes are
   passed to determine what the instruction is. Illegal instructions should
   still result in a valid returned tuple, where the integer part will be used
   by the disassemble command to skip that many bytes before disassembling the
   next instruction. The <i>address</i> can be used to display absolute
   destinations of program counter relative branches.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>set_program_counter</i></b> function sets the program
   counter in the processor. The <b><i>get_program_counter</i></b>
   function returns the current program counter.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>logical_to_physical</i></b> function translates a logical
   <i>address</i> to a physical address of the type defined by
   <i>access_type</i>. The function returns a <em>physical_block_t</em>
   struct with <i>valid</i> bit and the <i>address</i>. The
   address is valid when the valid bit is not <code>0</code>. The
   <b><i>logical_to_physical</i></b> function also returns
   <i>block_start</i> and <i>block_end</i>. The start and end
   of a block has the same logical to physical transformation as the translated
   address. The range is inclusive, so block_end should be the
   address of the last byte of the block.
   This information can be used to figure out how often the
   logical_to_physical function needs to be called. An implementation would
   typically return the page start and end here, but it is free to return any
   power of 2 sized block as long as it includes the translated address.
</p><p>
   The current operating mode of the processor is returned with
   <b><i>get_processor_mode</i></b>.
</p><p>
   The processor can be enabled or disabled with the
   <b><i>enable_processor</i></b> or <b><i>disable_processor</i></b>
   functions. The functions should return <code>0</code> if the processor
   changed from enabled to disabled or from disabled to enabled, and
   <code>1</code> if the processor did not change state. The current state
   is returned by the <b><i>get_enabled</i></b> function. Enabled or
   disabled here refers to the state that the user of the model has
   put the processor into. In particular, it is independent of the
   power mode of the processor. A processor that has powered down does
   not count as disabled in this sense, nor does the
   <b><i>enable_processor</i></b> wake up a processor that is in
   a power-saving sleep state.
</p><p>
   The endianness of the processor is returned by the
   <b><i>get_endian</i></b> function.
</p><p>
   The physical memory object is returned by the
   <b><i>get_physical_memory</i></b> function. The object returned by
   <b><i>get_physical_memory</i></b> is used to set breakpoints by the
   global <b>break</b> command, and to read and write physical
   memory through <b>set</b>, <b>get</b>,
   <b>load-binary</b>, <b>load-file</b>, and the default
   implementation of <b>disassemble</b>. The object returned
   implements the <code>memory_space</code> and
   <code>breakpoint</code> interfaces. The
   <code>memory_space</code> interface for the returned object is
   only be used in inquiry mode corresponding to actions by the
   simulator itself rather than by the simulated software. An
   implementation may return NULL from this method, which will lead to
   the command listed above not being supported when such a processor
   is selected.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_logical_address_width</i></b> function returns the
   number of logical/virtual address bits and the
   <b><i>get_physical_address_width</i></b> function returns the number
   of physical address bits.
</p><p>
   The processor architecture is returned by calling the
   <b><i>architecture</i></b> function. The architecture should be one of
   <code>arm</code>, <code>mips32</code>,
   <code>mips64</code>, <code>ppc32</code>, <code>ppc64</code>, <code>sparc-v8</code>,
   <code>sparc-v9</code>, <code>x86</code>, <code>x86-64</code>, or something else
   if none of the listed is a good match.
</p><p>
   All functions in the interface are optional. Each function can be
   set to NULL if it is not supported.

</pre><p>
</p><p>

   Note that the original version of this interface
   (<code>processor_info</code>) must also be implemented. The only
   difference between the two interfaces is that the original version lacks the
   <b><i>get_processor_mode</i></b> function.
</p><p>
   

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Processor-CLI-Interface">Processor CLI Interface</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="processor_cli"></a>
Some commands and features in the CLI use the
   <code>processor_cli</code> interface. Those commands will have
   limited functionality if the interface is not fully implemented.
</p><p>
   The first argument to each function is the object to act on. This object
   should implement both the <code>processor_info</code> interface and the
   <code>processor_cli</code> interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_disassembly</i></b> function is used for the
   <b>disassemble</b> command as well as to disassemble the next
   instruction to be executed, when control is returned to the CLI prompt. For
   most architectures, <b><i>get_disassembly</i></b> can be set to NULL, in which
   case the command will use other interfaces to provide a generic
   disassembly. The <b><i>get_disassembly</i></b> function should return a tuple
   with the length of the instruction in bytes and the disassembly string. The
   <i>addr_prefix</i> parameter selects the address type of the address
   parameter, whether it is a physical address ("p"), a linear address ("l") or
   a virtual address ("v"), just as returned from
   <b><i>get_address_prefix</i></b>. The <i>address</i> parameter is the
   program counter for the instruction to disassemble. If
   <i>print_cpu</i> is non-zero, then the name of the processor should
   be included first in the disassembly line. If <i>mnemonic</i> is not
   NULL, then it should be output instead of the instruction disassemble. The
   mnemonic is used to print exception or interrupt information as returned by
   the <b><i>get_pending_exception_string</i></b> function.
</p><p>
   <b><i>get_pregs</i></b> returns the string to output in the CLI for the
   <b>print-processor-registers</b> command. The <i>all</i>
   parameter is a boolean corresponding to the <i>-all</i> switch to the
   <b>print-processor-registers</b> command.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>diff_regs</i></b> function is used by the <b>stepi</b>
   command when the <i>-r</i> flag is used. The
   <b><i>diff_regs</i></b> function returns a list of register names,
   where each register in that list will be read through the
   <code>int_register</code> interface before and after an
   instruction.
</p><p>
   When returning to the CLI prompt, information about the next
   instruction or step to execute is printed. Normally, that is the
   disassemble of the instruction at the current program counter. The
   <b><i>get_pending_exception_string</i></b> function is called before
   the disassembly to find out if the next step will not be an
   instruction, but rather a taken exception or interrupt. The
   function should inspect the given <i>cpu</i> (an object
   implementing <code>processor_info</code> and
   <code>processor_cli</code>) and return NULL if the next step will
   be the execution of the instruction at the current program
   counter. If the next step will instead be the handling of an
   exception or interrupt, then a string saying that should be
   returned.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_address_prefix</i></b> function returns a string with
   the default address prefix for memory related commands. Simics
   defines the generic prefixes "v" for virtual addresses, "l" for
   linear addresses, and "p" for physical addresses. The default if
   <b><i>get_address_prefix</i></b> is NULL is "v" for virtual addresses.
</p><p>
   <b><i>translate_to_physical</i></b> translates an address to a
   physical address. If <b><i>translate_to_physical</i></b> is NULL, then
   the only allowed address prefixes are "v" (virtual) and "p"
   (physical), and the <b><i>logical_to_physical</i></b> function in the
   <code>processor_info</code> interface will be used to translate
   virtual addresses.

<a name="processor_gui"></a>
The <code>processor_gui</code> interface is implemented by
   processors that support displays in the Simics native GUI. It is
   only registered to indicate support for the displays, and does not
   contain any actual functionality.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Step-Interface">Step Interface</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="step"></a>
The <code>step</code> interface is typically implemented by
  processors, but can be implemented by other objects as well. Its
  purpose is to handle step events using a queue.
</p><p>
  The current number of steps for the <i>queue</i> is returned
  when calling <b><i>get_step_count</i></b>.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>post_step</i></b> function will schedule an event that will
  occur after <i>steps</i> (which must be nonnegative)
  counted from local current step at
  <i>queue</i>. An event previously posted can be removed by
  calling <b><i>cancel_step</i></b>. The <b><i>cancel_step</i></b> function takes a
  function <i>pred</i> as argument which is called when a matching
  event is found. The event is only removed if <i>pred</i> returns
  <code>1</code>. The <b><i>find_next_step</i></b> takes the same arguments
  as <b><i>cancel_step</i></b> but only returns the number of cycles before
  the event will occur. The <i>evclass</i> is the event class,
  <i>obj</i> is the object posting the event, and
  <i>user_data</i> is pointer to data used as a parameter when
  calling the callback function defined in the <i>evclass</i>.
  If no matching event was found, <b><i>find_next_step</i></b> returns
  −1.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>events</i></b> method returns a list of all pending events in
  expiration order. Each element is a four-element list containing the event
  object, the event class name, the expiration time counted in steps as an
  integer and the event description as given by the event class
  <b><i>describe</i></b> method, or <em>nil</em> for events whose event class do
  not define that method.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>advance</i></b> function will increment the number of steps
  for the queue, decrementing the number of steps to the first event
  to the value defined by <i>steps</i>. The number of steps remaining
  to the next event is returned. It is an error to advance beyond the
  next pending event, so the return value is never negative.
</p><p>
  The implementor of the <code>step</code> interface can use any
  checkpoint representation. The <i>name</i> field in the
  event class data structure is unique, and the attribute setter
  function for checkpoint restore can use
  <b><i>VT_get_event_class</i></b> to get the event class structure
  corresponding to an event class name.

<p>

<a name="int_register"></a>
<a name="Sim_RegInfo_Catchable"></a>
The <code>int_register</code>
   interface is used for access to registers in a processor.  It
   can be used to access any kind of integer register, not only the
   "normal" registers.  This includes all kinds of control registers,
   hidden registers and anything else that might be useful to access as
   a register.  The only limitation is that the register value should
   be representable as a 64-bit unsigned integer.
</p><p>
   This interface can be implemented by other classes than processors,
   but it is likely to be found mostly in processors.
 </p><p>
   Registers are identified by a number, and there are two functions
   to translate from register names to register numbers and back.  The
   translation need not be one-to-one, which means that one register
   can have several names.  A register name can, however, only
   translate to a single register number.
</p><p>
   Often, registers are grouped in <i>register banks</i>, where
   registers in the bank are numbered from 0 up. Registers in a bank
   should have consecutive numbers (unless their numbering is very sparse).
   This allows a user to deduce register numbers by calling
   <b><i>get_number</i></b> for the first register only.
   The first register numbers should be used for the general-purpose integer 
   registers, if possible (so that integer register <b>r</b>N has number N).
</p><p>
   Using this interface to read or write registers does not cause any
   side effects, such as triggering interrupts or signalling haps.
</p><p>
   <b>get_number</b> translates a register name to its number. Returns -1 if
   the register does not exist.
</p><p>
   <b>get_name</b> translates a register number to its canonical name.
</p><p>
   <b>read</b> reads a register value.
</p><p>
   <b>write</b> writes a new register value.
</p><p>
   <b>all_registers</b> returns a list of all register numbers that can
   be used for this object.
</p><p>
   <b>register_info</b> returns information about a single register.
   The information return depends on the <i>info</i> parameter.
</p><p>

   The <code>decoder</code> interface is implemented by processors
   that allows connecting user decoders. This allows a user to
   implement the semantics of instructions that are not available in
   the standard Simics model or change the semantics of instructions
   implemented by Simics. This interface replaces
   <b><i>SIM_register_arch_decoder</i></b> and
   <b><i>SIM_unregister_arch_decoder</i></b> functions.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>register_decoder</i></b> function adds a decoder and
   <b><i>unregister_decoder</i></b> removes a decoder.
</p><p>
   The decoder is installed/removed for every object of the same class as the
   <i>obj</i> argument which must be the same object from
   which the interface was fetched.
</p><p>
   When Simics decodes an instruction, it will first see if any
   instruction decoders are registered for the current CPU class.
   For any decoders it finds, Simics will let it try to decode the
   instruction.  The decoders are called in order, starting with the
   last registered decoder, and if one decoder accepts the instruction,
   the rest of the decoders will not be called.
</p><p>
   The decoder is specified by the <code>decoder_t</code> data structure that the 
   user supplies:
</p><p>
   
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef struct {
        void *user_data;

</p><p>
   <a name="decoder_t"></a>
</p><p>
   The <b><i>decode</i></b> function is called to decode an instruction
   pointed to by <i>code</i>.  The first byte corresponds to
   the lowest address of the instruction in the simulated
   memory. <i>valid_bytes</i> tells how many bytes can be
   read. The CPU is given in the <i>cpu</i> parameter.  When
   the decoder has successfully decoded an instruction, it should set
   the <i>ii_ServiceRoutine</i>, the <i>ii_Arg</i>, and the
   <i>ii_Type</i> members of the <i>ii</i> structure (see
   below), and returns the number of bytes used in the decoding.  If
   it does not apply to the given instruction, it should return zero.
   If the decoder needs more data than <i>valid_bytes</i> it
   should return a negative number corresponding to the total number
   of bytes it will need to continue the decoding. The underlying
   architecture limits the number of bytes that can be requested,
   e.g. no more than 4 bytes can be requested on most RISC
   architectures. Simics will call the decoder again when more bytes
   are available. This process is repeated until the decoder accepts
   or rejects the instruction.  A decoder should never request more
   data than it needs. For example, if an instructions can be rejected
   by looking at the first byte, the decoder should never ask for more
   bytes.
</p><p>
   The <code>instruction_info_t</code> is defined as follows:
</p><p>
   
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef struct instruction_info {
        service_routine_t  ii_ServiceRoutine;
        uint64             ii_Arg;
        unsigned int       ii_Type;
        lang_void         *ii_UserData;
        logical_address_t  ii_LogicalAddress;
        physical_address_t ii_PhysicalAddress;
} instruction_info_t;</pre><p>
</p><p>
   <a name="instruction_info_t"></a>
</p><p>
   <i>ii_ServiceRoutine</i> is a pointer to a function that will
   be called by Simics every time the instruction is executed. It has
   the following prototype:
   </p><p>
   
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef exception_type_t (*service_routine_t)(conf_object_t *cpu, 
                                              uint64 arg,
                                              lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>
<a name="service_routine_t"></a>
    
</p><p>
   The service routine function should return an exception when it is
   finished to signal its status. If no exception occurs
   <code>Sim_PE_No_Exception</code> should be returned.
</p><p>
   See <code>exception_type_t</code> in
   <code>src/include/simics/base/memory.h</code> for the different
   exceptions available.
</p><p>
   A special return value, <code>Sim_PE_Default_Semantics</code>, can be
   returned; this signals Simics to run the default semantics for the
   instruction. This is useful if the semantics of an instruction
   should be changed but the user routine does not want to handle it all
   the time.
</p><p>
   Note that in a shared memory multiprocessor, the CPU
   used in decoding may differ from the CPU that executes the
   instruction, since the decoded instructions may be cached.
</p><p>
   <i>ii_Arg</i> is the argument <i>arg</i> that will be
   passed on to the service routine function. Op code bit-fields for
   the instruction such as register numbers or intermediate values can
   be stored here. The <i>ii_UserData</i> field can also be used
   to pass information to the service routine if more data is needed.
</p><p>
   <i>ii_Type</i> is either <code>UD_IT_SEQUENTIAL</code> or
   <code>UD_IT_CONTROL_FLOW</code>.  A sequential type means that the
   instruction does not perform any branches and the update of the
   program counter(s) is handled by Simics. In a control flow
   instruction on the other hand it is up to the user to set the
   program counter(s).
</p><p>
   <i>ii_LogicalAddress</i> and <i>ii_PhysicalAddress</i>
   holds the logical and physical addresses of the instruction to be
   decoded.
</p><p>
   
</p><p>
   The <b><i>disassemble</i></b> function is called to disassemble an
   instruction.  It uses the same <i>code</i>,
   <i>valid_bytes</i>, and <i>cpu</i> parameters as
   the <b><i>decode</i></b> function. If the disassembly is valid, then
   the string part of the returned <code>tuple_int_string_t</code> struct
   should be a MALLOCed string with the disassembly and the integer
   part should be its length in bytes.  The caller is responsible for
   freeing the disassembly string. The string member should be NULL
   and the integer part should be zero if the disassembly is not
   valid.  If the disassemble function needs more data than
   <i>valid_bytes</i> it should return a negative number in
   the integer part in the same way as the <b><i>decode</i></b> function,
   and set the string part to NULL.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>flush</i></b> function is called to free any memory
   allocated when decoding an instruction and any user data associated
   with the instruction.  It should return zero if it does not
   recognize the instruction, and non-zero if it has accepted it.
   Usually, the way to recognize if a decoded instruction is the right
   one to flush is to compare <code>ii-&gt;ii_ServiceRoutine</code> with the
   function that was set in the <i>decode</i> function. Note
   that the <i>cpu</i> parameter is the processor that caused
   the flush. It is more or less an arbitrary processor and should be
   ignored.
</p><p>
   In addition to the function pointers, the
   <code>decoder_t</code> structure contains a
   <i>user_data</i> pointer that is passed to all the
   functions.  This can be used for passing any data to the decoder
   functions.

</p><p>
The <code>exception</code> interface is used together with the
Core_Exception hap to enable inspection abilities for triggered
exceptions.
</p><p>
The <code>exception</code> interface is used to translate
   exception numbers, as received by the Core_Exception hap, to names,
   and vice versa.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_number</i></b> function returns the number associated
   with an exception name, or -1 if the no exception with the given
   name exist. The <b><i>get_name</i></b> returns the name
   associated with an exception number. The <b><i>get_source</i></b>
   function is only used on X86 targets and returns the source for an
   exception, as an exception number can be raised from different
   sources. The <b><i>all_exceptions</i></b> function returns a list of
   all exceptions numbers.
</p><p>
   The exception numbers are architecturally defined, while their
   names are defined by the model.

The <code>exec_trace</code> interface is implemented by processor models
  that support tracing. A trace listener registers itself with the
  <b><i>register_tracer</i></b> call. The <i>tracer</i> callback will be

  when each instruction is just about to be executed, passing the

  The <i>pa</i> parameter to the callback will always be valid, but some

<a name="virtual_data_breakpoint"></a>
Add and remove virtual-address (and, on x86, linear-address) read and
     write breakpoints. On every read access that intersects a read
     breakpoint's interval, the registered callback function is called with the
     object that initiated the read, and the address and size of the read. (The
     interval includes both endpoints; <i>first</i> must be less than
     or equal to <i>last</i>.) Write breakpoints work exactly the same,
     except that the callback is given the actual value being written, not just
     its size.
</p><p>
     The callback is called before the read or write has taken place, but may
     not intervene. If one or more breakpoint callbacks stop the simulation,
     the current instruction is completed before the stop takes effect. If more
     than one breakpoint is triggered by the same read or write, the
     implementation may call their callbacks in any order.
</p><p>
     On x86, the <code>Virtual_Breakpoint_Flag_Linear</code> flag causes the

Add and remove virtual-address (and, on x86, linear-address) instruction
     breakpoints. Every time the processor executes an instruction that
     intersects the breakpoint's interval, the callback function is called with
     the processor, and the address and size of the instruction. (The interval
     includes both endpoints; <i>first</i> must be less than or equal
     to <i>last</i>.)
</p><p>
     The callback is called before the instruction is executed. If one or more
     breakpoint callbacks stop the simulation, the stop takes effect before
     the instruction is run. (This means that once the simulation starts
     again, the same breakpoints will trigger immediately again. The callback
     can use <b><i>VT_step_stamp</i></b> to detect re-triggering.) If more than
     one breakpoint is triggered by the same instruction, the implementation
     may call their callbacks in any order.
</p><p>
     If the filter function is non-null and returns false, the callback is not
     called. The filter function is supplied with the instruction opcode (the
     raw bytes of the instruction) and a processor (which may not be the same
     processor that the breakpoint is set on, but is guaranteed to be of the
     same class). The filter may base its decision only on the opcode bytes and
     the string obtained by asking the processor to disassemble the
     instruction; this allows the implementation to cache the result and omit
     future calls to the filter function where the opcode and disassembly
     string would be the same.

     On x86, the <code>Virtual_Breakpoint_Flag_Linear</code> flag causes the

</p><p>
  The <b><i>first_child</i></b> function returns the first description in the
  sequence of child descriptions of parent or NULL if parent has no
  children. Groups can have both registers and groups as children, registers
  can only have fields as children and fields cannot have any children. If
  parent is NULL, return the first description in the sequence of top-level
  descriptions.

  Use <b><i>next_description</i></b> to deallocate the previous description and
  return the next description in the sequence or NULL if there are no more
  descriptions in the current sequence.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>free_description</i></b> function is used to free the description
  without returning the next one in the sequence.

  The <b><i>first_named_value</i></b> function returns the first named value in
  the sequence of named values for parent or NULL if there are no named values
  for parent. Only fields and registers can have named values.
