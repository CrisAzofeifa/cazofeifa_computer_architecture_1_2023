<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">The <code>transaction_translator</code> interface is implemented by
   objects which would like to inspect and/or modify transactions
   before forwarding them to devices or address spaces. In Simics documentation,
   such objects are usually called translator objects or, simply, translators.
   In comparison with the simpler <code>translator</code> interface,
   the <code>transaction_translator</code> interface provides
   an opportunity to inspect/modify transactions. We recommend
   using the <code>translator</code> interface when the additional
   functionality is not needed.
<p>
   The interface has one method called <b><i>translate</i></b>. The arguments
   passed to this method describe the access and thus allow
   a translator to perform a proper translation. Here is a short description of
   the <b><i>translate</i></b> method's parameters:<br>
   - <i>addr</i> is an address of the access;<br>
   - <i>access</i> is a bitmask specifying all requested
   access types;<br>
   - <i>t</i> is a transaction;<br>
   - <i>callback</i> is a callback that should be called by
   the object implementing the interface;<br>
   - <i>data</i> should be passed to <i>callback</i>
   as it is when the callback is invoked by the translator object.<br>
   All these arguments are described in detail below.
</p><p>
   The transactions done by the translators may be cached by Simics.
   To ensure efficient flushing of Simics internal caches we recommend
   that the objects implementing the <code>transaction_translator</code>
   interface implement also the <code>translation_flush</code> interface.
   The absence of the <code>translation_flush</code> interface may lead to
   a substantial decrease of simulation speed.
</p><p>
   Whenever a previously returned translation becomes invalid the translator
   objects are expected to use either <b><i>SIM_map_target_flush</i></b>
   (preferably) or <b><i>SIM_translation_changed</i></b> function to ensure that
   Simics will flush any cached translations. Please refer to the documentation
   of these functions for the information about how they should be used.
</p><p>
   An object implementing the <code>transaction_translator</code> interface
   should invoke <i>callback</i> passing to it tree arguments:
   <i>translation</i>, <i>transaction</i>
   and <i>data</i>. The <i>translation</i> argument
   describes the translation that was done, i.e. the transaction destination.
   Please refer to the <code>translation_t</code> documentation
   for the complete description.
   The <i>transaction</i> argument is either the original
   transaction passed to the <code>transaction_translator</code> interface
   or, if a translator object wants to append atoms to the <i>t</i>
   transaction, a new transaction created via transaction chaining.
   The transaction chaining is described in detail in the "Transaction Chaining"
   chapter of the <em>Model Builder's User Guide</em>. Finally, the
   <i>data</i> argument is a parameter which should be passed as it is
   when <i>callback</i> is invoked by the translator object.
   Simics will report an error if a translator object doesn't invoke
   <i>callback</i> from the <b><i>translate</i></b> method
   of the <code>transaction_translator</code>.
</p><p>
   If it is needed, a translator may route transactions based on the value of
   certain <i>transaction</i>'s atoms. The <code>initiator</code> atom
   is a good example of such an atom. Please note that not all atoms are suited
   for routing transactions based on their value. This should be checked
   in the documentation for the specific atom.
</p><p>
   The <i>callback</i> function returns transaction completion status.
   This status should be usually returned as it is by the <b><i>translate</i></b>
   method. The status value is also needed in the case when a translator object
   appends atoms via transaction chaining with a non-zero
   <code>completion</code> atom. In that case the returned status should be used
   when the <b><i>SIM_monitor_chained_transaction</i></b> function is called.
</p><p>
   Please note that memory accesses in Simics are not always issued with
   the transactions of the <code>transaction_t</code> type.
   For example, memory access can be done with the use of
   the legacy <code>generic_transaction_t</code> type.
   One more such example is lookup accesses which are done
   via the <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface. All such accesses
   are converted, if it is needed, and presented to the translator object via
   the <i>t</i> parameter.
</p><p>
   The <i>access</i> parameter specifies access
   types in the form of a bitmask. Its value may be of interest
   if a translation is done differently based on whether it is
   a read, write or instruction fetch transaction. It can be noted
   that a transaction itself already contains information
   whether it is a read, write or an instruction fetch.
   Usually, the <i>access</i> parameter just reflects that value.
   However, for lookup accesses done via
   the <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface
   the <i>access</i> argument may have more bits set. If a translation
   which are valid for all requested accesses cannot be performed, then
   a null value should be set in the <i>target</i> of
   the <i>translation</i>
   argument passed to <i>callback</i>. In this case, the requestor is
   expected to repeat the interface call with just a single bit set
   in the access mask, e.g. <code>Sim_Access_Read</code>.
