<dt class="jdocu_descitem">Description</dt><dd class="jdocu_descitem">The x86 interface exports functionality used by several other objects to
   interact with the processor. The <b><i>set_pin_status</i></b> function is used
   to set/clear certain processor pins.
<p>
   <a name="x86_pin_t"></a>
    
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef enum {
        Pin_Init,
        Pin_Smi,
        Pin_Nmi,
        Pin_Ignne,
        Pin_Mcerr,
        Pin_Cmci
        /* Do not add new pins. Instead, define individual signal ports */
} x86_pin_t;</pre><p>

</p><p>
   The <b><i>start_up</i></b> function is used by the local APIC to bring the
   processor <i>obj</i> out of the waiting for start-up IPI state, with a
   start address of <i>start_address</i>.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>interrupt</i></b> function tells the CPU that an interrupt is
   waiting. The interrupt vector number is given by the <i>ack</i> callback
   function. It is not allowed to call the <i>ack</i> callback during the
   <b><i>interrupt</i></b> call itself. The <i>data</i> object should
   implement the <code>interrupt_cpu</code> interface. Note that the
   <code>interrupt_cpu</code> interface defines the <i>ack</i> function,
   which should be the same as the <i>ack</i> argument. It is recommended
   that new implementations does not use rely on the <i>ack</i> argument,
   but rather looks up the callback through the <code>interrupt_cpu</code>
   interface from the object given by the <i>data</i> argument. The
   <b><i>interrupt</i></b> function returns 1 if the interrupt is accepted, and 0
   if it is not accepted because there is already an interrupt queued up to be
   processed. If 0 is returned, the caller should retry the call after one
   step. It should wait one step since the handling of an interrupt takes one
   step.
</p><p>
   If a checkpoint was taken when an interrupt was waiting, the acknowledge
   callback function can be recovered by looking up the
   <code>interrupt_cpu</code> interface at the APIC object given in the
   <i>data</i> parameter.
</p><p>
   If the interrupt was cancelled before it was acknowledged, the
   <b><i>uninterrupt</i></b> function is used. It is also called by the
   acknowledge callback. Thus, each invocation of <b><i>interrupt</i></b> is
   followed by exactly one call to <b><i>uninterrupt</i></b> at all times.  The
   <i>ack</i> parameter is unused and should be ignored. When the processor
   is reset, it forgets a waiting interrupt so it is not necessary to call
   <b><i>uninterrupt</i></b> during a reset.
</p><p>
   The functions in the <code>interrupt_ack</code> interface provides almost
   the same functionality as the <b><i>interrupt</i></b> and
   <b><i>uninterrupt</i></b> functions in this interface. The only difference is
   that the <b><i>interrupt</i></b> function in this interface returns 0 when the
   interrupt cannot be handled which allows the device to retry later.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>has_pending_interrupt</i></b> and <b><i>has_waiting_interrupt</i></b>
   calls should return information about interrupts in progress. An interrupt
   is said to be pending if it is acked by the processor and will be taken
   before execution of the next instruction. An interrupt is waiting if the
   logical interrupt line is high, but the interrupt has not yet been
   acked. These functions are used for sanity checks by the APIC. The APIC
   should keep track of posted interrupts by itself. These functions return 1
   if an interrupt is pending/waiting, and 0 otherwise.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>logical_to_linear</i></b> function returns the translated linear
   address from the given logical address and segment register number. The
   function uses the current content of control registers and segment registers
   to calculate the linear address. The tagged return value is marked invalid
   if no valid translation exists, for example if the passed logical address is
   beyond the segment limit of the passed segment or if it is
   non-canonical. The encoding of <i>segment</i> is 0 for ES, 1 for CS, 2
   for SS, 3 for DS, 4 for FS, and 5 for GS.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>linear_to_physical</i></b> function returns the physical address
   corresponding to the given linear <i>address</i>. The function uses the
   current content of control registers, TLBs and possibly page tables to
   calculate the physical address. A return value of -1 signals that no valid
   mapping exists.
</p><p>
   <b><i>enter_acpi_c2_state</i></b> is called from the chipset power module to
   request the CPU to enter an energy-saving state.
