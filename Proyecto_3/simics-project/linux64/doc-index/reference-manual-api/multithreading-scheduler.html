<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="multithreading-scheduler">2.9 Simics Scheduler</a></h1>
<p>

The Simics scheduler is responsible for ensuring that models implementing the
<code>execute</code> interface are scheduled. It is also
responsible for mapping actual threads to the simulation workload and
for keeping distinct CPUs synchronized in virtual time.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="multithreading-scheduler-basic">2.9.1 Basic Operation</a></h2>
<p>

The Simics Scheduler compiles a list of simulation tasks that can be
run in parallel. Each task consists of a thread domain with
one or more models implementing the <code>execute</code> interface.
</p><p>
The number of tasks that can be simulated in parallel depends on the
thread domain partitioning, which in turn depends on the selected
simulation mode. The simulation mode is configurable with the
<b>set-threading-mode</b> command.
</p><p>
The available tasks are mapped to a set of execution threads
managed by the scheduler. The number of threads used
depends on the host hardware and any limit imposed by the user.
The latter is settable with the <b>set-thread-limit</b> command.
</p><p>
A particular simulation task is usually simulated from a specific
simulation thread in order to maximize cache locality. However, a task can be
migrated to another thread when this is needed for load-balancing reasons.
Thus, a model should not make any assumptions about the thread it is simulated
from.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="multithreading-scheduler-sync">2.9.2 Virtual Time Synchronization</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The scheduler ensures that all CPUs (and clocks) are kept synchronized
in virtual time. More specifically, the virtual time for
a pair of CPUs are not allowed to differ more than a fixed amount.
A simulation task becomes blocked when it is about to break this
invariant.
</p><p>
If a single thread domain contains more than one object implementing the
<code>execute</code> interface, then the scheduler switches between
them in a round-robin fashion. Each executor is simulated until the
virtual time has advanced one <em>time-quantum</em>. The interval
is settable with the <b>set-time-quantum</b> command.
</p><p>
The time difference for CPUs in the same cell, but in distinct
thread domains, is not allowed to exceed the <em>max-time-span</em>
limit. The limit is settable with the <b>set-max-time-span</b>
command and is usually of the same order of magnitude as the time quantum.
</p><p>
The time difference between CPUs in distinct cells is kept below
the <em>min-latency</em> limit. This limit is set with
the <b>set-min-latency</b> command. The min-latency is often allowed
to be a bit higher than the other limits.
