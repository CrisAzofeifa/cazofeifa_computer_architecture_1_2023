</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This document describes the API used to implement models of processors
in Simics. Simics will handle the simulation framework, including the
user interfaces, standardized APIs, plug-in administration, and
commonly used utilities and resources. The processor models use and
implement the standardized APIs, which allows mixing simulation models and
creating a uniform interface to the user.
</p><p>
The processor API is the part of the API that allows a model to get
control over simulator scheduling and includes processor specific interfaces to
enable standard functions and commands for the processor models as well as
efficient memory interfaces to allow fast simulation. The most
important interfaces are covered in this document, for the other
interfaces please refer to the relevant Simics reference Manual.
</p><p>
Depending on use, the processors should implement and use different
parts of the interfaces described.
</p><p>
A number of areas that a processor model may support can be identified
as follows:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:simulation-scheduling"><b>Simulation scheduling</b></dt><dd>There must be basic support for advancing the simulation. This
  support must be present for any fast functional processor
  model. Cycle driven models may be designed using the built-in clock
  class that handles the scheduling interaction with the
  framework.</dd><dt id="dt:direct-access-to-memory"><b>Direct Access to Memory</b></dt><dd>Interfaces used to cache pointers to memory, allowing accesses to
be carried out without involving the API.</dd><dt id="dt:inspection-and-control-of-processor-models"><b>Inspection and control of processor models</b></dt><dd>As processors are very visible to the user of the simulator, there
are several standardized ways for the user to access and control a
processor. To support these, the processor models in turn have to
implement interfaces and trigger haps.</dd><dt id="dt:breakpoints"><b>Breakpoints</b></dt><dd>The processor model is fully responsible for triggering virtual
address breakpoints. For physical address breakpoints, the processor
model needs to check if ranges mapped with direct memory access
contain breakpoints and then either request more fine grained regions
of memory without breakpoints or fall back to explicit memory
operations, where the explicit memory operations will handle
breakpoints if they happen to match.</dd><dt id="dt:simulation-of-models"><b>Simulation of models</b></dt><dd>Covers the mechanisms used to communicate between processors and
devices.</dd></dl><p>Like any other model, processor models should be written to integrate well into
the Simics environment. See <em>Simics Model Development Checklist</em> for
a good checklist to follow when designing and implementing the model. See also
the <em>Simics User's Guide</em> for more information about the features
discussed in this document.
</p><p>
How to configure a system and create start scripts is described in the
<em>Model Builder User's Guide</em>. Example system configurations can be
found in <code>[simics]/targets/cosim/</code>.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="cosimulator-examples">2 Processor Scheduling Examples</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This chapter describes how to interface processors to Simics depending
on the requirements on the simulation.
</p><p>
A processor model defines one or more classes to integrate with the
Simics environment. Simics classes have attributes and implement
interfaces. Even though Simics classes can be written in <i>DML</i>,
<i>C</i>, <i>C++</i>, or <i>Python</i>, only <i>C</i> and <i>C++</i>
is currently supported for writing processor models. See the
<i>Configuration and Checkpointing</i> chapter in the <em>Simics User's
Guide</em> for more information about classes in Simics and how to
instantiate them into Simics objects.
</p><p>
A key issue for fast simulation is how it is scheduled. A
<em><a name="scheduler">scheduler</a></em> is an object that implements the
<code>execute</code> interface. Such an object advances virtual time
for itself and for the objects associated with it. A processor that
also is a scheduler can thus simulate a sequence of instructions that
occur at different points in virtual time without having to return
back to the framework.
</p><p>
Processors can be scheduled in any of the following ways:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:processors-without-custom-scheduling"><b>Processors without custom scheduling</b></dt><dd>Processors models do not have any customized scheduling, but
rather use event callbacks to perform simulation. This setup is
suitable for clock cycle driven simulation as it performs simulation
in strict virtual time order. See figure <a class="reference" href="#exact_time_model">1</a>.</dd><dt id="dt:scheduling-a-set-of-processors"><b>Scheduling a set of processors</b></dt><dd>The processors are scheduled together, and a single object
implements the <code>execute</code> and <code>cycle</code>
interfaces used by the framework to schedule the set of processors,
see figure <a class="reference" href="#cosim_queue_in_blobb">2</a>. This type of
scheduling allows the simulation to run faster since it requires less
synchronization and fewer context switches. The drawback is that both
the <code>cycle</code> interface and the optional
<code>step</code> interface are hard to implement.</dd><dt id="dt:scheduling-each-processor"><b>Scheduling each processor</b></dt><dd>The <code>execute</code> and <code>cycle</code> interfaces are
here implemented in each thread/core objects instead of in a central
scheduler object, see figure <a class="reference" href="#execute_per_thread">3</a>. This
is the model used by all Simics standard processors models. The
multiple clocks in this type of setup are forced by Simics to stay
within a defined window of virtual time. As the clocks are driven
individually, this leads to temporal decoupling between the
processors.</dd></dl><p>The documentation for the <code>execute</code> interface describes
how the Simics core controls the simulation, see Section <a class="reference" href="#execute-interface">3.1</a>.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="exact-time-model">2.1 Processor Models without Custom Scheduling</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Cycle driven models are typically slow models. The setup only has one
clock object which handles timing for all objects in the setup. All
objects run in lock step mode where each object run one cycle at a
time. Figure <a class="reference" href="#exact_time_model">1</a> shows an example setup of
event driven processors. The type of simulation where this setup
should be used are for example clock cycle accurate HDL simulator
models.

</p><p>
In the setup shown in figure <a class="reference" href="#cosim_queue_in_blobb">2</a>, the
processors export one implementation of the time event queue instead
having a Simics object do that. The result is that the processor
model has better control of when new events are added and also that
the processor model triggers the events. The Simics core instructs the
scheduler to run the simulation forward through the
<code>execute</code> interface. All objects in a cell implementing
the <code>execute</code> interface will be kept within a time window
defined by the <i>time_quantum</i> attribute of the cell. Having
a quantum that is significantly larger than a single cycle (as in a
cycle driven model) allows for faster simulation since optimizations
such as binary translation and hypersimulation can then be employed.

parallel with multiple threads.  Note that care must be taken if
typical Simics processor model features such as deterministic
execution and reverse execution are to be supported.

In the setup shown in figure <a class="reference" href="#execute_per_thread">3</a>, each
processor implements the scheduling interfaces. This is a special case
of the previous mechanism where each set of processors only include a
single processor. The Simics core instructs the scheduler to run the
simulation forward through the <code>execute</code> interface. All
objects in a cell implementing the <code>execute</code> interface
will be kept within a time window defined by the

This chapter describes the interfaces used for customized simulation
scheduling.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="execute-interface">3.1 Execute Interface</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="execute"></a>

</p><p>
   The <code>execute</code> interface is implemented by objects that
   drive a simulation, which is often processor models. The object
   does not have to implement <code>cycle</code> or
   <code>step</code>.
</p><p>
   An object implementing the <code>execute</code> interface must be
   coupled with one object implementing the <code>cycle</code>
   interface. It can be the same object that implements the
   <code>cycle</code> interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>run</i></b> function is called when the simulator starts or
   restarts the execution.
</p><p>
   The implementation of the <b><i>run</i></b> function is responsible
   for maintaining the simulators view of the current objects
   implementing the <code>processor_info</code> and
   <code>step</code> interfaces. It does
   that by using the appropriate functions in the
   <code>cell_inspection</code> interface. The current objects must
   always be correctly set when either the <b><i>run</i></b> function
   returns, when any API method is called, or when any other object is
   called through an interface. Several Simics features, such as CLI
   commands, device logging, and hap handling make use of the current
   objects.
</p><p>
   To handle asynchronous events, and thus allow for reasonable interactive
   performance, the implementor of <code>execute</code> needs to either make
   sure that <b><i>run</i></b> returns after not having run for too long, or
   preferably regularly call the <b><i>VT_check_async_events</i></b> method. In
   the Simics library CPU models, <b><i>VT_check_async_events</i></b> is called
   after servicing events from the <code>cycle</code> or <code>step</code>
   interfaces.
</p><p>
   The simulator core will call <b><i>stop</i></b> when it detects a
   condition that should interrupt the simulation. The callee should
   stop as soon as possible when in a stable state, typically when the
   current executing instruction is finished after getting a request
   to stop. In some cases the callee might receive multiple stop
   requests in a rapid sequence. Conditions leading to a stop request
   include <b><i>SIM_break_simulation</i></b> being called from a device
   or hap-handler, breakpoint triggered, low-memory situations, the
   user interrupting the simulation with Ctrl-C, and the Simics core
   halting the object when it is at the end of the allowed time window
   in temporal decoupled simulation. It is forbidden to do anything in
   the <b><i>stop</i></b> function that can lead to a new stop request,
   this includes posting events, printing <b><i>SIM_log</i></b>-messages,
   etc. Before returning from the <b><i>run</i></b> method, the
   <b><i>VT_stop_event_processing</i></b> function should be called. The
   requirement to call <b><i>VT_stop_event_processing</i></b> is likely
   to be lifted in future versions of Simics.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>switch_in</i></b> function is called whenever the
   execute object is about to gain control of the simulation
   from some other execute object in the cell. Similarly,
   <b><i>switch_out</i></b> is invoked before control is relinquished.
   It should be noted that these functions are called in a
   deterministic manner which is not true for <b><i>run</i></b>.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>switch_in</i></b> and <b><i>switch_out</i></b> functions
   are not called at simulation start (or checkpoint load), in
   general.
</p><p>
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">
SIM_INTERFACE(execute) {

        void (*switch_out)(conf_object_t *obj);

</pre><p>
</p><p>

   
</p><p>
In figure <a class="reference" href="#execute_fig">4</a> there is an example call-graph of
Simics core and processor scheduler communication. Simics posts events
on the processor's event queues to be triggered, for instance, at
the end of the allowed time window. Simics then calls the
<b><i>run</i></b> function in the <code>execute</code> interface and
the processor starts executing instructions. The processor which
implements the event queues will after a while execute an event
callback for the event posted by the Simics core in one of the event
queues. The Simics core handles the event which will trigger a stop
request via the <b><i>stop</i></b> function. Note that not all events
will trigger a stop request. Having received <b><i>stop</i></b>, the
processor model must stop the simulation as soon as possible and
return to the Simics core. This is typically done as soon as the
currently executing instruction is committed.

</p><p>
   The <code>cell_inspection</code> interface is implemented by
   objects of the cell class. It is used by objects implementing the
   <code>execute</code> interface to update the currently executing
   objects when control is transferred outside of the execute object.
</p><p>
   The current object implementing <code>processor_info</code> is set with
   <b><i>set_current_processor_obj()</i></b>. Similarly, the current object
   implementing <code>step</code> is set with
   <b><i>set_current_step_obj()</i></b>.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Cycle-Interface">3.3 Cycle Interface</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="cycle"></a>

</p><p>
  </p><dl><dt id="dt:interface-methods"><b>Interface Methods</b></dt><dd>The <code>cycle</code> interface is typically implemented by
  processors, but can be implemented by other objects as well. Its purpose is
  to handle events based on time. The cycle queue has a cycle as the smallest
  time unit. The cycle queue also has an associated frequency which makes it
  possible to define events based on seconds or picoseconds.
<p>
  The <b><i>get_frequency</i></b> function returns the frequency in Hertz for
  the <i>queue</i>. Most objects implementing <code>cycle</code> also
  have a notification mechanism for frequency changes through the
  <code>simple_dispatcher</code> interface in the <i>cpu_frequency</i>
  port. It is recommended that such a notification mechanism is used to get
  updates rather than polling with <b><i>get_frequency</i></b>.
</p><p>
  The current number of cycles executed by the <i>queue</i> is returned
  by <b><i>get_cycle_count</i></b>. Time elapsed since the queue was created is
  returned by <b><i>get_time</i></b> (in seconds) and <b><i>get_time_in_ps</i></b>
  (in picoseconds); this will be equal to the value returned
  by <b><i>get_cycle_count</i></b> divided by the value returned
  by <b><i>get_frequency</i></b> if the frequency has been constant since time
  zero.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>cycles_delta</i></b> function returns the highest number of cycles
  <i>obj</i> can run <em>before</em> it passes the absolute local time
  <i>when</i>, assuming no frequency change occurs in the
  meantime. Note that <b><i>cycles_delta</i></b> can raise an exception if
  <i>when</i> was too far ahead in the future. The
  <b><i>cycles_delta_from_ps</i></b> function performs the same function, for an
  absolute local time expressed in picoseconds.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>post_cycle</i></b> function will schedule an event that will occur
  after <i>cycles</i> counted from local current time at
  <i>queue</i>. The <b><i>post_time</i></b> function is similar but takes
  <i>seconds</i> as argument, while <b><i>post_time_in_ps</i></b> takes
  a number of <i>picoseconds</i>. The arguments
  <i>cycles</i>, <i>seconds</i> and
  <i>picoseconds</i> must be nonnegative.
</p><p>
  An event previously posted can be removed by calling <b><i>cancel</i></b>. The
  <b><i>cancel</i></b> function takes a function <i>pred</i> as argument
  which is called when a matching event is found. The event is only removed if
  <i>pred</i> returns <code>1</code>. 
</p><p>
  The <b><i>find_next_cycle</i></b>, <b><i>find_next_time</i></b> and
  <b><i>find_next_time_as_ps</i></b> functions take the same arguments as
  <b><i>cancel</i></b> but only return the number of cycles, seconds or
  picoseconds before the event occur. The <i>evclass</i> is the event
  class, <i>obj</i> is the object posting the event, and
  <i>user_data</i> is pointer to data used as a parameter when calling
  the callback function defined in the <i>evclass</i>.
  If no matching event was found, <b><i>find_next_cycle</i></b> and
  <b><i>find_next_time</i></b> return −1;
  <b><i>find_next_time_as_ps</i></b> returns <code>ILLEGAL_DURATION</code>.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>events</i></b> method returns a list of all pending events in
  expiration order. Each element is a four-element list containing the event
  object, the event class name, the expiration time counted in cycles as an
  integer and the event description as given by the event class
  <b><i>describe</i></b> method, or NIL for events whose event class does not
  define that method.
</p><p>
  What happens to already posted events when a frequency change occurs is
  implementation dependent. Simics processors will scale the cycle queue to
  keep the time left before triggering events equal across the frequency
  change. Note that the new times will be rounded to entire cycles during the
  scaling, so approximations may occur when switching between high and low
  frequencies.</p></dd><dt id="dt:implementation"><b>Implementation</b></dt><dd>It is implementation dependent how the queue is implemented, whether
  cycles or seconds are used as underlying time unit, and what happens when the
  frequency is changed.
<p>
  Objects implementing the cycle interface are usually meant to be scheduled by
  Simics itself. For this to happen, a number of conditions must be fulfilled:
</p><p>
  </p><ul>

  <li>Each schedulable object implementing the <code>cycle</code> interface
  must be controlled by an object implementing the <code>execute</code>
  interface. It can be the same object that implements the
  <code>execute</code> interface. The object implementing the
  <code>execute</code> interface points to the object implementing the
  <code>cycle</code> interface via its <i>queue</i> attribute.</li>

  <li>Any schedulable object implementing the <code>cycle</code> interface
  must inform Simics about changes in frequency by calling the
  <b><i>VT_clock_frequency_change</i></b> function. That also applies to the
  initial frequency set when the object is created.</li>

  <li>For schedulable objects, the <code>cycle</code> interface must be
  registered with <b><i>SIM_register_clock</i></b>, which will also add some
  Simics specific attributes to the corresponding class. Beyond those, the
  implementor of the <code>cycle</code> can use any checkpoint
  representation. The <i>name</i> field in the event class data
  structure is unique, and the attribute setter function for checkpoint restore
  can use <b><i>VT_get_event_class</i></b> to get the event class structure
  corresponding to an event class name.</li>

<p>


   <a name="direct_memory_lookup_t"></a>
</p><p>
   The <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface is implemented by Simics
   memory-spaces. The interface is used by simulator objects that want to do
   fast accesses to memory and/or want to build up a cached representation of
   memory. These objects are referred to as memory users, e.g., processors.
   Fast accesses are done via host pointers to simulated memory. The
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface is used in conjunction with
   the <code>direct_memory</code> interface which is implemented by objects
   that own the actual data storage, e.g., RAM/ROM objects. These objects are
   called direct-memory objects.
</p><p>
   To access data, a memory-user object first calls the <b><i>lookup</i></b>
   method on the memory space <i>obj</i>. The
   <i>requester</i> is the memory-user doing the lookup.
   The <b><i>lookup</i></b> method traces the range specified by
   <i>addr</i> and <i>size</i>
   through memory spaces and translators until a direct-memory object
   is reached. The direct-memory object is returned in the
   <i>target</i> field and the offset into this object
   corresponding to <i>addr</i> is returned in the
   <i>offs</i> field.
</p><p>
   The call to <b><i>lookup</i></b> fails if the specified range does
   not map continuously to a direct-memory object. A lookup failure
   is indicated by returning NULL in the <i>target</i> field.
</p><p>
   The <i>access</i> argument is a bit field of at least one
   <code>access_t</code> value specifying what kind of accesses the memory user
   is interested in. All specified access types must reach the same
   direct-memory object and range for the lookup to succeed. If the memory
   space, for example, redirects reads and writes to different memory ranges or
   direct-memory objects, a lookup would fail if <i>access</i>
   specified both read and write. Note that the actual access permissions
   needed to access the real data must be requested from
   the direct-memory object using the <b><i>request</i></b> method of
   the <code>direct_memory</code> interface. The <i>access</i>
   argument is only used to locate the direct-memory object.
</p><p>
   The return field <i>access</i> contains at least the access
   bits requested used in the lookup request, but may as an optimization
   contain a superset, indicating that the lookup result is valid for this
   superset. However, there is no guarantee that this optimization
   takes place.
</p><p>
   Once a direct-memory object has been found, the <code>direct_memory</code>
   interface can be used to obtain a direct pointer to the contents
   of the direct-memory object.
</p><p>
   The <i>tracers</i> and <i>breakpoints</i> fields in the
   return value contain information about installed tracers and breakpoints
   that intersect the range. Examples of tracers are timing models
   and snoop objects. In order to trigger breakpoints and invoke any tracers,
   the memory user should perform memory operations using the
   <code>memory_space</code> interface. Only breakpoints and tracers that
   overlap (binary and) with the provided <i>access</i> argument need to be
   considered.

   interfaces replace the <code>memory_page</code> interface of Simics 4.8.

   <a name="direct_memory_handle_t"></a>
   <a name="direct_memory_ack_id_t"></a>
   <a name="direct_memory_t2"></a>
</p><p>
   The <code>direct_memory</code> interface is implemented by objects that
   model memory, such as RAM and ROM objects. These are called direct-memory
   objects. A user of the interface is called a memory user and is
   typically a processor that wants to do fast accesses to memory. The
   direct-memory object corresponding to a particular physical address
   can be obtained using the <b><i>lookup</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface.
   See the documentation for the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface for more information.
</p><p>
   A memory user using the <code>direct_memory</code> interface 
   must implement the <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_handle</i></b> method is used by a memory user
   to create or retrieve a handle to the memory region starting
   at offset <i>offs</i> with size <i>size</i>.
   The handle is typically used later on to request access permissions
   and to retrieve a direct pointer to the region.
   The handle returned by <b><i>get_handle</i></b> is private to the
   memory user specified in the <i>requester</i> parameter.
</p><p>
   If <b><i>get_handle</i></b> is invoked multiple times for the same
   range, and with identical <i>requester</i> and
   <i>subsystem</i> arguments, then the same handle will
   be returned each time, assuming the original handle is still valid.
   Note that the original handle is only returned if the range
   matches exactly. A single memory user can obtain multiple
   distinct handles for the same memory range by using different values for the
   <i>subsystem</i> parameter.
</p><p>
   For RAM and ROM, <i>offs</i> and <i>size</i> must
   specify a region which does not intersect a naturally aligned
   8192 byte boundary, or the request will fail with a NULL return
   value. Other direct-memory objects might have different requirements.   
</p><p>
   The <b><i>request</i></b> method is used to request a host pointer to simulated
   memory. This pointer can be used to carry out fast memory operations without
   having to involve the Simics API. The <i>handle</i> argument is the
   handle obtained using <b><i>get_handle</i></b>.
</p><p>
   Both the <i>permission</i> argument and the <i>inhibit</i> argument
   are <code>access_t</code> type bit fields. The <i>permission</i>
   argument is used to specify what kind of memory operations the memory user
   will perform. For example, if a memory user wants to read memory, the
   <i>permission</i> argument must include the Sim_Access_Read value.  The
   <i>inhibit</i> argument specifies what other memory users are not
   allowed to do. For example, if <i>inhibit</i> is set to Sim_Access_Write
   other memory users are not allowed to write to the memory range.  This
   protection mechanism can be used to create caches of simulated memory,
   request exclusive permissions to a memory range in order to carry out atomic
   operations, and similar.  When a memory user is requesting permission to a
   memory range that another memory user has protected with conflicting inhibit
   bits, the direct-memory object will inform the other memory user of
   the lost permissions and protection through the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.  A user can lose both the
   permission and protection for a memory range in this way. When this happens,
   a memory user may re-request permissions and inhibit protection.
</p><p>
   Note: if a memory user has multiple handles which overlaps, then
   each handle is considered to be a distinct memory user. For example,
   if a memory user holds two handles, and requests write inhibit on
   one of them, then write permission will be revoked from the second
   handle (if such permission had been granted).
</p><p>
   The <b><i>request</i></b> method returns a <code>direct_memory_t</code> value
   with information about the retrieved permissions and inhibit bits. These
   bits can be a super set of the bits that actually was requested. The
   returned data pointer can be used to access the memory range. Accesses are
   valid from the data pointer and up to the end of the range, i.e., addresses
   up to data pointer + <i>size</i> - 1, where size is the size valid for
   the handle. A call to <b><i>request</i></b> always succeeds and the
   corresponding memory range is valid until the permissions or the handle are
   revoked by the <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.  Note that the
   data pointer may change each time <b><i>request</i></b> is called (with the
   same handle) since Simics may move simulated memory. If the pointer
   changes, then the old pointer must not be used.
</p><p>
   With <b><i>set_user_data</i></b>, a memory user can associate 
   a user-defined pointer with a specific handle. The pointer can
   be retrieved using the <b><i>get_user_data</i></b> method, which takes
   a <i>handle</i> as an argument.
</p><p>
   A memory user can use the <b><i>release</i></b> function to notify the
   direct-memory object when it is no longer interested in the memory
   region corresponding to <i>handle</i>. The handle is invalid
   and must not be used for anything after being released.
   </p><p>
   The <b><i>ack</i></b> method is used by a memory user to inform the 
   direct-memory object that it has given up the corresponding permission and
   inhibit rights for a memory range when called by a method in the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.
</p><p>
   Permissions can be revoked from all memory users by invoking the
   <b><i>revoke</i></b> method. The <i>permission</i> parameter
   specifies the permissions which will be revoked from all memory users.
   Similarly, <i>inhibit</i> specifies the inhibit privileges which
   will be revoked. For instance, calling <b><i>revoke</i></b> with
   <i>permission</i>
   set to <code>Sim_Access_Write</code> will ensure that nobody has
   write permissions to the direct-memory object.

<p>


</p><p>
   The <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface must be implemented by
   memory-user objects that use the <code>direct_memory</code> interface.
</p><p>
   The <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface replaces the
   <code>memory_page_update</code> interface from Simics 4.8.
</p><p>
   Accesses to memory are controlled by a handle that the memory-user object
   requests by calling the <b><i>get_handle</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface. The object implementing the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface through which the handle was
   established is passed to the functions in
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> as <i>target</i>.
</p><p>
   If the <b><i>release</i></b> method is called, the corresponding
   <i>handle</i> and all the permissions and inhibit protections are
   recalled. The memory-user object must stop using the handle and
   associated data pointers and then call the acknowledge method
   <b><i>ack</i></b> in the <code>direct_memory</code> interface from
   which the handle was granted.
</p><p>
   A call to the <b><i>update_permission</i></b> method revokes earlier requested
   rights for a handle. The <i>lost_access</i> argument recalls rights to
   use the handle for the given access bits. This means that the handle needs
   to be re-fetched (by a call to the <b><i>lookup</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface followed by a call to the
   <b><i>get_handle</i></b> method of the <code>direct_memory</code> interface)
   before the handle can be used again for the particular access. This typically
   happens if a new breakpoint is inserted or a remap of the memory system is
   done. In case of a remap it is possible that the same handle will never be
   returned again which means that any user data associated with the handle
   should be reclaimed. 
</p><p>
   The <i>lost_permission</i> and the <i>lost_inhibit</i> arguments
   describe which permission rights and inhibit protection that are
   revoked. However, in contrast to the <i>lost_access</i>, the
   <i>handle</i> is still valid and can be used to re-request permission
   rights and inhibit protection.
</p><p>
   A call to the <b><i>conflicting_access</i></b> method informs a memory-user
   object that a conflicting memory operation will be performed. Hence, if the
   memory-user object have some protected representation of memory (such as
   decoded instructions in an internal cache), that representation of memory
   has to be flushed (or written back to memory in case of dirty data). Note
   however that the memory-user object does not lose any permission rights or
   any inhibit protection. 
</p><p>
   There is no mechanism for locking simulated memory in host memory.
</p><p>
   All methods in this interface receive a <code>direct_memory_ack_id_t</code>
   value as an argument. The <b><i>ack</i></b> method of the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface must be called with this
   <i>id</i> as an argument when the corresponding operation has been
   carried out. The <b><i>ack</i></b> method may be called after the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface function has returned, which
   allows for queueing of update requests. This may be valuable if multiple
   simulator threads are used.
</p><p>
   An exception to the allowed queueing of update requests is for update
   requests that are received while calling <b><i>request</i></b> in the
   <code>direct_memory</code> interface. Such requests must be handled
   immediately with <b><i>ack</i></b> being called before the return of the
   <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface function. This requirement
   avoids a dead-lock that would otherwise happen if <b><i>request</i></b> would
   wait for <b><i>ack</i></b> before returning, but <b><i>ack</i></b> is
   queued to be handled at some time after <b><i>request</i></b> has returned.

support the same generic feature set as Simics standard processor
models. If you intend to plug your model into an existing
Simics-provided platform, then many of these interfaces are actually
required for such a platform to function.

</p><p>
   The <code>processor_info_v2</code> interface is implemented by
   processors models. The interface has processor generic functions
   that are architecture independent.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>disassemble</i></b> function returns the disassemble string for an
   instruction at <i>address</i> with opcode according to
   <i>instruction_data</i>. The <i>instruction_data</i> is an
   <em>attr_value_t</em> value of <em>data</em> type with the bytes of the
   opcode. The bytes are in the same order as they are stored in memory. For
   VLIW architectures, <i>sub_operation</i> is used to select which
   sub-operation to disassemble. The sub-operations start at zero, and a
   request for the entire unit including all sub-operations is encoded with
   sub-operation -1. A request for a sub-operation that is not present (for
   example when <i>sub-operation</i> is neither 0 nor -1 for non-VLIW
   architectures) results in the integer part of the return tuple being set to
   zero. If successful, the function should return a tuple with the size of the
   instruction in bytes and the disassembly string. The disassembly string
   should be allocated with MM_MALLOC or similar and is to be freed by the
   caller. If more bytes are needed, then the function should indicate that by
   returning a negative number in the tuple where the absolute value of the
   number is the required number of bytes. The string should be NULL if more
   bytes are needed. The implementor of <code>processor_info_v2</code> is
   allowed to request one additional byte at a time until enough bytes are
   passed to determine what the instruction is. Illegal instructions should
   still result in a valid returned tuple, where the integer part will be used
   by the disassemble command to skip that many bytes before disassembling the
   next instruction. The <i>address</i> can be used to display absolute
   destinations of program counter relative branches.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>set_program_counter</i></b> function sets the program
   counter in the processor. The <b><i>get_program_counter</i></b>
   function returns the current program counter.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>logical_to_physical</i></b> function translates a logical
   <i>address</i> to a physical address of the type defined by
   <i>access_type</i>. The function returns a <em>physical_block_t</em>
   struct with <i>valid</i> bit and the <i>address</i>. The
   address is valid when the valid bit is not <code>0</code>. The
   <b><i>logical_to_physical</i></b> function also returns
   <i>block_start</i> and <i>block_end</i>. The start and end
   of a block has the same logical to physical transformation as the translated
   address. The range is inclusive, so block_end should be the
   address of the last byte of the block.
   This information can be used to figure out how often the
   logical_to_physical function needs to be called. An implementation would
   typically return the page start and end here, but it is free to return any
   power of 2 sized block as long as it includes the translated address.
</p><p>
   The current operating mode of the processor is returned with
   <b><i>get_processor_mode</i></b>.
</p><p>
   The processor can be enabled or disabled with the
   <b><i>enable_processor</i></b> or <b><i>disable_processor</i></b>
   functions. The functions should return <code>0</code> if the processor
   changed from enabled to disabled or from disabled to enabled, and
   <code>1</code> if the processor did not change state. The current state
   is returned by the <b><i>get_enabled</i></b> function. Enabled or
   disabled here refers to the state that the user of the model has
   put the processor into. In particular, it is independent of the
   power mode of the processor. A processor that has powered down does
   not count as disabled in this sense, nor does the
   <b><i>enable_processor</i></b> wake up a processor that is in
   a power-saving sleep state.
</p><p>
   The endianness of the processor is returned by the
   <b><i>get_endian</i></b> function.
</p><p>
   The physical memory object is returned by the
   <b><i>get_physical_memory</i></b> function. The object returned by
   <b><i>get_physical_memory</i></b> is used to set breakpoints by the
   global <b>break</b> command, and to read and write physical
   memory through <b>set</b>, <b>get</b>,
   <b>load-binary</b>, <b>load-file</b>, and the default
   implementation of <b>disassemble</b>. The object returned
   implements the <code>memory_space</code> and
   <code>breakpoint</code> interfaces. The
   <code>memory_space</code> interface for the returned object is
   only be used in inquiry mode corresponding to actions by the
   simulator itself rather than by the simulated software. An
   implementation may return NULL from this method, which will lead to
   the command listed above not being supported when such a processor
   is selected.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_logical_address_width</i></b> function returns the
   number of logical/virtual address bits and the
   <b><i>get_physical_address_width</i></b> function returns the number
   of physical address bits.
</p><p>
   The processor architecture is returned by calling the
   <b><i>architecture</i></b> function. The architecture should be one of
   <code>arm</code>, <code>mips32</code>,
   <code>mips64</code>, <code>ppc32</code>, <code>ppc64</code>, <code>sparc-v8</code>,
   <code>sparc-v9</code>, <code>x86</code>, <code>x86-64</code>, or something else
   if none of the listed is a good match.
</p><p>
   All functions in the interface are optional. Each function can be
   set to NULL if it is not supported.

   Note that the original version of this interface
   (<code>processor_info</code>) must also be implemented. The only
   difference between the two interfaces is that the original version lacks the
   <b><i>get_processor_mode</i></b> function.

</p><h4 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Processor-CLI-Interface">Processor CLI Interface</a></h4>
<p>

<a name="processor_cli"></a>

</p><p>
   Some commands and features in the CLI use the
   <code>processor_cli</code> interface. Those commands will have
   limited functionality if the interface is not fully implemented.
</p><p>
   The first argument to each function is the object to act on. This object
   should implement both the <code>processor_info</code> interface and the
   <code>processor_cli</code> interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_disassembly</i></b> function is used for the
   <b>disassemble</b> command as well as to disassemble the next
   instruction to be executed, when control is returned to the CLI prompt. For
   most architectures, <b><i>get_disassembly</i></b> can be set to NULL, in which
   case the command will use other interfaces to provide a generic
   disassembly. The <b><i>get_disassembly</i></b> function should return a tuple
   with the length of the instruction in bytes and the disassembly string. The
   <i>addr_prefix</i> parameter selects the address type of the address
   parameter, whether it is a physical address ("p"), a linear address ("l") or
   a virtual address ("v"), just as returned from
   <b><i>get_address_prefix</i></b>. The <i>address</i> parameter is the
   program counter for the instruction to disassemble. If
   <i>print_cpu</i> is non-zero, then the name of the processor should
   be included first in the disassembly line. If <i>mnemonic</i> is not
   NULL, then it should be output instead of the instruction disassemble. The
   mnemonic is used to print exception or interrupt information as returned by
   the <b><i>get_pending_exception_string</i></b> function.
</p><p>
   <b><i>get_pregs</i></b> returns the string to output in the CLI for the
   <b>print-processor-registers</b> command. The <i>all</i>
   parameter is a boolean corresponding to the <i>-all</i> switch to the
   <b>print-processor-registers</b> command.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>diff_regs</i></b> function is used by the <b>stepi</b>
   command when the <i>-r</i> flag is used. The
   <b><i>diff_regs</i></b> function returns a list of register names,
   where each register in that list will be read through the
   <code>int_register</code> interface before and after an
   instruction.
</p><p>
   When returning to the CLI prompt, information about the next
   instruction or step to execute is printed. Normally, that is the
   disassemble of the instruction at the current program counter. The
   <b><i>get_pending_exception_string</i></b> function is called before
   the disassembly to find out if the next step will not be an
   instruction, but rather a taken exception or interrupt. The
   function should inspect the given <i>cpu</i> (an object
   implementing <code>processor_info</code> and
   <code>processor_cli</code>) and return NULL if the next step will
   be the execution of the instruction at the current program
   counter. If the next step will instead be the handling of an
   exception or interrupt, then a string saying that should be
   returned.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_address_prefix</i></b> function returns a string with
   the default address prefix for memory related commands. Simics
   defines the generic prefixes "v" for virtual addresses, "l" for
   linear addresses, and "p" for physical addresses. The default if
   <b><i>get_address_prefix</i></b> is NULL is "v" for virtual addresses.
</p><p>
   <b><i>translate_to_physical</i></b> translates an address to a
   physical address. If <b><i>translate_to_physical</i></b> is NULL, then
   the only allowed address prefixes are "v" (virtual) and "p"
   (physical), and the <b><i>logical_to_physical</i></b> function in the
   <code>processor_info</code> interface will be used to translate
   virtual addresses.

</p><p>
  The <code>step</code> interface is typically implemented by
  processors, but can be implemented by other objects as well. Its
  purpose is to handle step events using a queue.
</p><p>
  The current number of steps for the <i>queue</i> is returned
  when calling <b><i>get_step_count</i></b>.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>post_step</i></b> function will schedule an event that will
  occur after <i>steps</i> (which must be nonnegative)
  counted from local current step at
  <i>queue</i>. An event previously posted can be removed by
  calling <b><i>cancel_step</i></b>. The <b><i>cancel_step</i></b> function takes a
  function <i>pred</i> as argument which is called when a matching
  event is found. The event is only removed if <i>pred</i> returns
  <code>1</code>. The <b><i>find_next_step</i></b> takes the same arguments
  as <b><i>cancel_step</i></b> but only returns the number of cycles before
  the event will occur. The <i>evclass</i> is the event class,
  <i>obj</i> is the object posting the event, and
  <i>user_data</i> is pointer to data used as a parameter when
  calling the callback function defined in the <i>evclass</i>.
  If no matching event was found, <b><i>find_next_step</i></b> returns
  −1.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>events</i></b> method returns a list of all pending events in
  expiration order. Each element is a four-element list containing the event
  object, the event class name, the expiration time counted in steps as an
  integer and the event description as given by the event class
  <b><i>describe</i></b> method, or <em>nil</em> for events whose event class do
  not define that method.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>advance</i></b> function will increment the number of steps
  for the queue, decrementing the number of steps to the first event
  to the value defined by <i>steps</i>. The number of steps remaining
  to the next event is returned. It is an error to advance beyond the
  next pending event, so the return value is never negative.
</p><p>
  The implementor of the <code>step</code> interface can use any
  checkpoint representation. The <i>name</i> field in the
  event class data structure is unique, and the attribute setter
  function for checkpoint restore can use
  <b><i>VT_get_event_class</i></b> to get the event class structure
  corresponding to an event class name.

<a name="int_register"></a>
<a name="Sim_RegInfo_Catchable"></a>
 The <code>int_register</code>
   interface is used for access to registers in a processor.  It
   can be used to access any kind of integer register, not only the
   "normal" registers.  This includes all kinds of control registers,
   hidden registers and anything else that might be useful to access as
   a register.  The only limitation is that the register value should
   be representable as a 64-bit unsigned integer.
</p><p>
   This interface can be implemented by other classes than processors,
   but it is likely to be found mostly in processors.
 </p><p>
   Registers are identified by a number, and there are two functions
   to translate from register names to register numbers and back.  The
   translation need not be one-to-one, which means that one register
   can have several names.  A register name can, however, only
   translate to a single register number.
</p><p>
   Often, registers are grouped in <i>register banks</i>, where
   registers in the bank are numbered from 0 up. Registers in a bank
   should have consecutive numbers (unless their numbering is very sparse).
   This allows a user to deduce register numbers by calling
   <b><i>get_number</i></b> for the first register only.
   The first register numbers should be used for the general-purpose integer 
   registers, if possible (so that integer register <b>r</b>N has number N).
</p><p>
   Using this interface to read or write registers does not cause any
   side effects, such as triggering interrupts or signalling haps.
</p><p>
   <b>get_number</b> translates a register name to its number. Returns -1 if
   the register does not exist.
</p><p>
   <b>get_name</b> translates a register number to its canonical name.

   instruction decoders are registered for the current CPU class.
   For any decoders it finds, Simics will let it try to decode the
   instruction.  The decoders are called in order, starting with the
   last registered decoder, and if one decoder accepts the instruction,
   the rest of the decoders will not be called.
</p><p>
   The decoder is specified by the <code>decoder_t</code> data structure that the 
   user supplies:
</p><p>
   
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef struct {
        void *user_data;

</p><p>
   The <b><i>decode</i></b> function is called to decode an instruction
   pointed to by <i>code</i>.  The first byte corresponds to
   the lowest address of the instruction in the simulated
   memory. <i>valid_bytes</i> tells how many bytes can be
   read. The CPU is given in the <i>cpu</i> parameter.  When
   the decoder has successfully decoded an instruction, it should set
   the <i>ii_ServiceRoutine</i>, the <i>ii_Arg</i>, and the
   <i>ii_Type</i> members of the <i>ii</i> structure (see
   below), and returns the number of bytes used in the decoding.  If
   it does not apply to the given instruction, it should return zero.
   If the decoder needs more data than <i>valid_bytes</i> it
   should return a negative number corresponding to the total number
   of bytes it will need to continue the decoding. The underlying
   architecture limits the number of bytes that can be requested,
   e.g. no more than 4 bytes can be requested on most RISC
   architectures. Simics will call the decoder again when more bytes
   are available. This process is repeated until the decoder accepts
   or rejects the instruction.  A decoder should never request more
   data than it needs. For example, if an instructions can be rejected
   by looking at the first byte, the decoder should never ask for more
   bytes.
</p><p>
   The <code>instruction_info_t</code> is defined as follows:
</p><p>
   
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef struct instruction_info {
        service_routine_t  ii_ServiceRoutine;
        uint64             ii_Arg;
        unsigned int       ii_Type;
        lang_void         *ii_UserData;
        logical_address_t  ii_LogicalAddress;
        physical_address_t ii_PhysicalAddress;
} instruction_info_t;</pre><p>
</p><p>
   <a name="instruction_info_t"></a>
</p><p>
   <i>ii_ServiceRoutine</i> is a pointer to a function that will
   be called by Simics every time the instruction is executed. It has
   the following prototype:
   </p><p>
   
   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef exception_type_t (*service_routine_t)(conf_object_t *cpu, 
                                              uint64 arg,
                                              lang_void *user_data);</pre><p>
<a name="service_routine_t"></a>
    
</p><p>
   The service routine function should return an exception when it is
   finished to signal its status. If no exception occurs
   <code>Sim_PE_No_Exception</code> should be returned.
</p><p>
   See <code>exception_type_t</code> in
   <code>src/include/simics/base/memory.h</code> for the different
   exceptions available.
</p><p>
   A special return value, <code>Sim_PE_Default_Semantics</code>, can be
   returned; this signals Simics to run the default semantics for the
   instruction. This is useful if the semantics of an instruction
   should be changed but the user routine does not want to handle it all
   the time.
</p><p>
   Note that in a shared memory multiprocessor, the CPU
   used in decoding may differ from the CPU that executes the
   instruction, since the decoded instructions may be cached.
</p><p>
   <i>ii_Arg</i> is the argument <i>arg</i> that will be
   passed on to the service routine function. Op code bit-fields for
   the instruction such as register numbers or intermediate values can
   be stored here. The <i>ii_UserData</i> field can also be used
   to pass information to the service routine if more data is needed.
</p><p>
   <i>ii_Type</i> is either <code>UD_IT_SEQUENTIAL</code> or
   <code>UD_IT_CONTROL_FLOW</code>.  A sequential type means that the
   instruction does not perform any branches and the update of the
   program counter(s) is handled by Simics. In a control flow
   instruction on the other hand it is up to the user to set the
   program counter(s).
</p><p>
   <i>ii_LogicalAddress</i> and <i>ii_PhysicalAddress</i>
   holds the logical and physical addresses of the instruction to be
   decoded.
</p><p>
   
</p><p>
   The <b><i>disassemble</i></b> function is called to disassemble an
   instruction.  It uses the same <i>code</i>,
   <i>valid_bytes</i>, and <i>cpu</i> parameters as
   the <b><i>decode</i></b> function. If the disassembly is valid, then
   the string part of the returned <code>tuple_int_string_t</code> struct
   should be a MALLOCed string with the disassembly and the integer
   part should be its length in bytes.  The caller is responsible for
   freeing the disassembly string. The string member should be NULL
   and the integer part should be zero if the disassembly is not
   valid.  If the disassemble function needs more data than
   <i>valid_bytes</i> it should return a negative number in
   the integer part in the same way as the <b><i>decode</i></b> function,
   and set the string part to NULL.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>flush</i></b> function is called to free any memory
   allocated when decoding an instruction and any user data associated
   with the instruction.  It should return zero if it does not
   recognize the instruction, and non-zero if it has accepted it.
   Usually, the way to recognize if a decoded instruction is the right
   one to flush is to compare <code>ii-&gt;ii_ServiceRoutine</code> with the
   function that was set in the <i>decode</i> function. Note
   that the <i>cpu</i> parameter is the processor that caused
   the flush. It is more or less an arbitrary processor and should be
   ignored.
</p><p>
   In addition to the function pointers, the
   <code>decoder_t</code> structure contains a
   <i>user_data</i> pointer that is passed to all the
   functions.  This can be used for passing any data to the decoder
   functions.

   The <code>exception</code> interface is used to translate

     Add and remove virtual-address (and, on x86, linear-address) read and

     Add and remove virtual-address (and, on x86, linear-address) instruction

</p><p>
     The callback is called before the instruction is executed. If one or more

     the instruction is run. (This means that once the simulation starts
     again, the same breakpoints will trigger immediately again. The callback

     may call their callbacks in any order.

     If the filter function is non-null and returns false, the callback is not

     raw bytes of the instruction) and a processor (which may not be the same
     processor that the breakpoint is set on, but is guaranteed to be of the
     same class). The filter may base its decision only on the opcode bytes and
     the string obtained by asking the processor to disassemble the
     instruction; this allows the implementation to cache the result and omit
     future calls to the filter function where the opcode and disassembly
     string would be the same.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-Haps">5.3 Using Haps</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
A <a name="hap">hap</a> is an event or occurrence in Simics with some specific semantic
meaning, either related to the target or to the internals of the
simulator. Haps can for instance be used by the cosimulator to trigger
events on control register reads or writes.
</p><p>
The cosimulator calls one of the <b><i>SIM_c_hap_occurred...</i></b> functions to
trigger a hap. The <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> lists standard haps to
trigger. The <em>Simics User's Guide</em> document describes how to get
a callback when a hap is triggered.
</p><p>
To be fully compatible with regular Simics CPU models, a cosimulator
should trigger the following haps:
<a name="hapCore_Exception2"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Exception_Return"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Asynchronous_Trap"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Control_Register_Read"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Control_Register_Write"></a>
<a name="hapCore_External_Interrupt"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Sync_Instruction"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Mode_Switch"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Interrupt_Status"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Magic_Instruction"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Mode_Change"></a>
</p><ul>
<li>Core_Exception</li>
<li>Core_Exception_Return</li>
<li>Core_Asynchronous_Trap</li>
<li>Core_Control_Register_Read</li>
<li>Core_Control_Register_Write</li>
<li>Core_External_Interrupt</li>
<li>Core_Sync_Instruction</li>
<li>Core_Mode_Switch (x86 processors only)</li>
<li>Core_Interrupt_Status (x86 processors only)</li>
<li>Core_Magic_Instruction</li>
<li>Core_Mode_Change</li>
</ul>
<p>
Details about the haps can be found in the <em>Simics Reference
Manual</em>, or online with the <b>list-haps</b> command. The
<b>sample-risc</b> module in
<code>[simics]/src/extensions/sample-risc/</code> contains example
code how to raise <em>Core_Control_Register_Read</em> and
<em>Core_Control_Register_Write</em> haps.
</p><p>
The cosimulator should not trigger the following haps as they are
triggered by the Simics core:
<a name="hapCore_Breakpoint"></a>
<a name="hapCore_Breakpoint_Memop"></a>
</p><ul>
<li>Core_Breakpoint</li>
<li>Core_Breakpoint_Memop</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="processor-api-breakpoints">6 Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="breakpoint"></a>
</p><p>
Breakpoints in Simics are set on physical, linear, or virtual address
for read, write, or execute accesses. Linear address breakpoints are
usually only supported by x86 processors. Figure <a class="reference" href="#processor_api_breakpoints">5</a> shows how to carry out a memory
access to support breakpoints.
</p><p>
</p><div class="figure" id="processor_api_breakpoints">

<div style="text-align: center">
<img alt="" src="processor_api_breakpoints.png">
<div class="caption">Figure 5. Memory access path with breakpoint support and direct access to memory.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>
Simics keeps an updated list of virtual breakpoints for a given
virtual context in a context object. A processor object must make sure
that all accesses are checked against the list and trigger a
breakpoint when there is a hit.
</p><p>
<a name="context"></a>
<a name="breakpoint_trigger"></a>
The processor object may cache the list internally for efficiency. A
processor that does not optimize the breakpoint checking internally
can request that the context checks and triggers breakpoints. It does
that by calling the <b><i>trigger_breakpoint</i></b> function in the
<code>breakpoint_trigger</code> interface with the <i>handle</i>
set to <i>BREAKPOINT_HANDLE_ANY</i>.
</p><p>
There are two ways that the list of virtual address breakpoints can
change and the processor must then refresh or invalidate its
breakpoint information cache:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Breakpoints may be added to or removed from a context.</li>
<li>The current active context may change to another context.</li>
</ul>
<p>
<a name="hapCore_Breakpoint_Change"></a>
<a name="breakpoint_change"></a>
Breakpoint changes can be listened for either using the
<em>Core_Breakpoint_Change</em> hap, or by registering callbacks
through the <code>breakpoint_change</code> interface.
</p><p>
<a name="context_handler2"></a>
The active context is changed through the <b><i>set_context</i></b>
function in the <code>context_handler</code> interface.
</p><p>
<a name="direct_memory_lookup"></a>
<a name="memory_space"></a>
The <code>direct_memory_lookup</code> interface will return
information flagging if breakpoints or tracers are present on a
returned lookup. If breakpoints or tracers are flagged and overlap
with the access type the direct memory user wants to perform, then the
access should be performed using the <code>memory_space</code>
interface. When accessing memory through
the <code>memory_space</code> interface, physical address
breakpoints will be handled by the memory-space and do not need to be
handled in the cosimulator. Unlike for virtual breakpoints, the
cosimulator does not need to listen for new or changed physical
breakpoints. Any change to a physical breakpoint on a requested page
will result in the page being invalidated through
the <code>direct_memory_update</code> interface.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Breakpoint-Query-Interface">6.1 Breakpoint Query Interface</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="breakpoint_query_v2"></a>

</p><p>
   Objects of the <b>context</b> and <b>memory-space</b>
   classes implement the <code>breakpoint_query_v2</code> interface. It is
   used by processors to check for breakpoints.
</p><p>
   Implementors of this interface should use
   <b><i>SIM_register_compatible_interfaces</i></b> after
   <b><i>SIM_register_interface</i></b> to also register earlier versions of the
   interface.
</p><p>
   The <b><i>get_breakpoints</i></b> function returns a set of
   breakpoints that intersect the range given in <i>start</i> and
   <i>end</i>, including both start and end in the range. Only
   breakpoints set on access types with bits set in
   <i>read_write_execute</i> will be returned.
</p><p>
   When information from <b><i>get_breakpoints</i></b> has been processed, the
   breakpoints array in the breakpoint_set_t structure should be freed with
   MM_FREE.

</p><p>
   The <code>breakpoint_change</code> interface is implemented by
   objects that wish to get notified when breakpoints are added,
   removed, or changed in some way.
</p><p>
   The object that wants to get notified of changes to breakpoints in
   a another object would use the <code>simple_dispatcher</code> in
   the breakpoint_change port of that other object. The other object
   will then lookup the <code>breakpoint_change</code> interface in
   the object to notify and use that when breakpoint updates occur.
</p><p>
   The breakpoint_change port is implemented by objects of the
   <b>cell</b> class, and a listener that registers on a cell with get
   notified on any breakpoint changes in that cell.

<p>

<a name="breakpoint_trigger2"></a>

</p><p>
   Objects implementing the <code>breakpoint</code> interface
   typically also implement the <code>breakpoint_trigger</code>
   interface. Processors call the <b><i>trigger_breakpoint</i></b>
   function to signal that a memory access intersects a
   breakpoint. The <b><i>trigger_breakpoint</i></b> function will raise
   the appropriate haps and the currently scheduled execute object may
   receive a <b><i>stop</i></b> call during the call to
   <b><i>trigger_breakpoint</i></b>.
</p><p>
   The <i>obj</i> argument is the object that holds the
   breakpoint, typically a memory space or a context
   object. <i>initiator_obj</i> is the source of the memory
   operation that triggers the breakpoint. The <i>handle</i>
   argument identifies the breakpoint to trigger. A value of
   <i>BREAKPOINT_HANDLE_ANY</i> can be passed as
   <i>handle</i>, in which case all the breakpoints that match the
   given <i>address</i>, <i>size</i>, and <i>access</i>
   will be triggered. The <i>address</i>, <i>size</i>, and
   <i>access</i> arguments specify information about the access
   that triggers the breakpoint. The <i>data</i> argument points
   to a buffer where the data for the access is kept.
</p><p>
   If a <b><i>stop</i></b> is received during a call to
   <b><i>trigger_breakpoint</i></b>, then it is recommended that any
   software visible actions carried out after the breakpoint are
   logged. That could for example be to notify the user if the entire
   instruction that triggers a breakpoint will complete, and that the
   instruction will then not be re-executed when the simulation
   restarts.
