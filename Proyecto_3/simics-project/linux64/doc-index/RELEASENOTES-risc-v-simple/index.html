<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This document identifies important information for the RISC-V Simple
package for Simics 6. All users of this specific package
should review this document carefully.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Minor-Changes-Since-Simics-6.0.0">2 Minor Changes Since Simics 6.0.0</a></h2>
<p>

The following is a list of changes since the initial Simics
6.0.0 release.
</p><p>
</p><ul><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6215"></a>6.0.2 (build 6215)
</p><ul><li><b>RISC-V* Simple Target</b><ul><li>Changed the package name so it now reads
    RISC-V-Simple (bug #SIMICS-20861).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6213"></a>6.0.pre1 (build 6213)
</p><ul><li><b>RISC-V* Simple Target</b><ul><li>Updated default time quantum to
    1ms (bug #SIMICS-16868).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6209"></a>6.0.pre0 (build 6209)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li>Simics no longer comes with documentation
  in PDF format.</li><li>Documentation in HTML format has been added.
  </li><li> Fixed a problem on Windows where the
    installer still asked for
    the Model Builder key (bug #SIMINT-1236). </li><li> Support for Python 2.7 has been removed.
    Simics now only embeds
    a Python 3 interpreter. </li><li> The separation of source code into separate
    packages has been
    removed. Source code is now included directly into
    each package. </li><li> The installers for Linux and macOS have
    been updated.
    Support for fallback mode of decryption keys has
    been removed. </li></ul></li><li><b>RISC-V* Simple Target</b><ul><li>Added rootfs as target parameter. Added a default device tree blob
    and as text so it is possible to make changes and compile it manually.</li><li>Updated target guide to contain new target parameters
    and info regarding building a linux kernel, root file system and boot loader. Instructions
    how to modfify the device tree was also added.</li><li>The main RISC-V script has been
  converted to a Simics target, which can be used
  with <b>load-target</b>.</li><li>The RISC-V target scripts
    now require a simics-base version of at least 6.0.154 to work.
    Virtio devices provided by simics-base as of 6.0.154 are required.</li><li>Add option to include a disk image
    for the virtion block device.</li><li>Use new target parameter framework</li><li>Renamed the default target script from
    <code>simple-linux.simics</code> to <code>linux.simics</code></li><li>Changed default number of cores to 4</li><li>Changed default core class to <code>riscv-rv64</code>
    from <code>riscv-u74</code></li><li>Added parameter <code>setup_ethernet</code>
    to setup connection to host</li><li>The RISC-V target scripts
    now require a simics-base version of at least 6.0.153 to work.</li><li>Fixed a bug in the RISC-V target
  that prevented it from being loaded in the same Simics session as
  another non-RISC-V target.</li><li>The package no longer
  contains <code>.pyc</code> files, and now requires Simics-Base version
  6.0.114 or later.</li><li>Target scripts were updated to use
  new breakpoint manager commands. The package now requires
  Simics-Base version 6.0.82 or later.</li><li>Show better error message on
      invalid secondary core configuration.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

This section briefly describes the known limitations of the
RISC-V Simple package. Please refer to section
<a class="reference" href="#Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5</a> for a more technical
description.
</p><p>
For model oriented packages, additional limitations may be found in
the model target guides.

<p>

This section describes in detail the known limitations of the
RISC-V Simple package. Please refer to
section <a class="reference" href="#Limitations">4</a> for a more general description.
</p><p>
A register or field marked as <i>Not implemented</i> is present with
read-write semantics but has no side effects on simulation. A register
marked as <i>Not implemented (design limitation)</i> has the same
semantics as a "Not implemented" register and there is no
plan to extend the model with this functionality. A register with
<i>Lack of documentation</i> has not been implemented because there is
no available documentation describing its semantics.
