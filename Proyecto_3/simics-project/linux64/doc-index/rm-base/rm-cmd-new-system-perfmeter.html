The probe-based system-perfmeter is a tool for sampling probes specifically for looking at Simics performance aspects. The tool extends the probe-monitor, sharing the same commands and features. Compared to the probe-monitor, some default probes are automatically used. There are also handy flags which can be used when creating the tool to more easily subscribe on additional performance related probes.
<p>
<b>Argument description:</b>
</p><p>
Create a new system-perfmeter object with a <i>name</i>. If name is not given a unique name will be created for it automatically. The system-perfmeter samples probes in the system either at a regular interval or when a notification is raised.
</p><p>
The <i>sampling-mode</i> argument specifies the mode used to perform sampling. Default is "realtime-sync" when the interval is in realtime (wallclock), but also synchronized so all processor have executed at least one quantum since last sample.
</p><p>
With the "realtime" sampling mode, sampling is based on the wallclock time only, without any synchronization. Some probes might yield strange results, when some processors have not executed at all since the last sample.
</p><p>
Mode can also be "virtual", where the virtual time is used to perform sampling. The time is based on the virtual time of the first processor found in the system, unless <i>clock</i> is set to override the default one with another clock or processor.
</p><p>
In "realtime-sync", "realtime" and "virtual" modes the interval is set in seconds by the <i>interval</i> argument.
</p><p>
Another available mode is "notifier" where sampling is performed each time a notification is raised. <i>notifier-type</i> specifies the notifier type and <i>notifier-obj</i> the object where the notifier is installed.
</p><p>
The <i>timestamp-file</i> specifies a file to be used recording specific timepoints when the sampling should take place. Together with realtime-sync the file will be created and filled with the cycle count from the <i>clock</i> argument, when the samples are taken.
</p><p>
With the time-stamp sampler, this file will instead be used as an input file, and the sampling will take place on the cycles specified in the file.
</p><p>
Probes to sample are added by the <tt>&lt;system-perfmeter&gt;.add-probe</tt> command.
</p><p>
Output handling. By default, each sample measured by the probe-monitor, will print a table row on standard output. (A table row can consist of multiple lines being printed, including repeated headers).
</p><p>
The <i>output-file</i> argument specifies if the run-time table rows should be printed to a file, including any summary output.
</p><p>
The <tt>-window</tt> switch will cause the run-time samples to be printed in a separate console instead of the standard output.
</p><p>
The <tt>-print-no-samples</tt> switch specifies that no samples are printed to standard output, or a window, during execution. Any file output, with the <i>output-file</i> argument will still occur.
</p><p>
If <tt>-summary</tt> is given a summary of all sampled probes will be printed every time the simulation is stopped.
</p><p>
The sample data history is also stored in memory, so the data can be viewed at any time through the <tt>&lt;system-perfmeter&gt;.print-table</tt> command. When sampling at a high frequency, it is recommended to not produce any sample output while running, reducing the overhead of the probe-monitor.
</p><p>
The probe-based system perfmeter automatically adds the probes: <i>sim.time.virtual</i>, <i>sim.time.wallclock</i> (both session and delta). These show the virtual time and wallclock time spent during the simulation. Note that any time spent when not simulating (standing at the Simics prompt), is removed from the wallclock time.
</p><p>
Further the <i>sim.slowdown</i> delta probe is automatically shown, giving the ratio between the virtual time passed compared to the wallclock time. That is, a number below 1.0 means the virtual time passes faster than the wallclock, a figure of 5.0 means that one virtual second takes five wallclock seconds to simulate.
</p><p>
The <i>sim.process.cpu_percent</i> delta probe shows much much host processor usage the Simics process is taking. Any value below 100% indicates Simics gets blocked on something, such as real-time mode. On a four processor host, the maximum value would be 400% indicating Simics manages to can schedule work on all processors simultaneously. Note that processor usage might be from from other threads, not just the execution threads which are used for the actual simulation.
</p><p>
Finally, the <i>sim.load_percent</i> delta probe, shows an average of much actual instructions that is being simulated per cycle. With 100%, all simulation time is spent actually executing instructions. Processors might also wait for interrupts or other events, when cycles are consumed without executing any instructions, reducing this value. This average value takes into account how much cycles each processor actually consume, so differences in frequencies matter. Any processor specific IPC value (other than 1.0) is also taken into consideration. The IPC value may not change during simulation however.
</p><p>
There are a number of additional flags to easily add more probes to the system-perfmeter directly when starting the tool. All of these probes shows the <i>delta</i> values, that is, the difference between each sample.
</p><p>
The <tt>-mips</tt> flag adds the <i>sim.mips</i> probe, which reports the overall number of instructions per wallclock second being executed. Similarly, the <tt>-cpu-mips</tt> adds the <i>cpu.mips</i> probe which tells how many instructions per "second", each individual CPU is executing, based on the amount of time it is actually scheduled.
</p><p>
The <tt>-exec-modes</tt> flags adds the <i>sim.exec_mode.hypersim_percent</i>, <i>sim.exec_mode.vmp_percent</i>, <i>sim.exec_mode.jit_percent</i>, and the <i>sim.exec_mode.interpreter_percent</i> probes. These report the summary of which execution modes all processors have been executed in.
</p><p>
Similarly, the <tt>-cpu-exec-modes</tt> flag adds the corresponding <i>cpu.exec_mode.</i> probes, reporting the execution modes per individual processor in the system.
</p><p>
The <tt>-cpu-schedule-percent</tt> flag adds the <i>cpu.schedule_percent</i> probe which reports the percentage of the scheduled simulation time spent in the specific processors. Processors with high percentage simulates more slowly.
</p><p>
The <tt>-cpu-load</tt> flag adds the <i>cpu.load_percent</i> which gives the individual load on each processor. See above for the description of the <i>sim.load_percent</i> probe.
</p><p>
The <tt>-module-profile</tt> flag adds the <i>sim.module_profile</i> probe which gives a low overhead performance profile of in which shared objects the execution is spent.
</p><p>
The <tt>-io</tt> flag adds the <i>sim.io_intensity</i> probe, reporting how frequently IO operations occurs, as number of executed instructions per detected IO operation. High values are good, low values could cause performance reductions.
</p><p>
These are just some generally useful switches for adding probes easily directly when creting the system-perfmeter. Once system-perfmeter object has been created, it is possible to remove existing probes or add other probes to the sampling.
