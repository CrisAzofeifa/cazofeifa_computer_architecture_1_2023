This document describes the CRAFF on-disk file format independently of
its implementation. There is also a short discussion of possible
improvements.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
CRAFF (Compressed Random-Access File Format) is designed for storing large,
sparse linear address spaces such as memory or disk dumps in a portable way.
</p><p>
To the user, a CRAFF file appears as a collection of addressable data
blocks. The file can be sparse (blocks can be missing), and the presence
of each block can be queried.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Conceptual-structure">Conceptual structure</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The file format consists of a header, which contain parameters, and the
data arranged as a radix tree:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">                root dir
   root ----&gt; +---------+
              |---------|       lvl 1 dir
              |---------|----&gt; +---------+
              |---------|      |---------|       lvl 2 dir
              +---------+      |---------|----&gt; +---------+
                               |---------|      |---------|       data block
                               +---------+      |---------|----&gt; +---------+
                                                |---------|      |         |
                                                +---------+      |         |
                                                                 |         |
                                                                 +---------+
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The header contains the size of each tree node (directory) and of the
data blocks, and a pointer to the root directory block. The number of
tree levels is implicit in the size of the directory and data blocks,
and of the highest address used.
</p><p>
The is also a list of free blocks which have been created as other blocks
have been erased. These free blocks are used when adding new data to the
file. If the free block list is empty, new data is added last in the file.

</p><p>
All fields are unsigned integers unless stated otherwise, and all are
stored in big-endian byte order.
</p><p>
The file header comes first in the file, and contains the following fields:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Offset   Size    Field           Description
     0      4    magic           must be 0x89bf1e83 (in big-endian order)
     4      4    version         file format version. This document
                                 describes the version 1 format.
     8      4    block_bits	    log2 of the data block size in bytes.
                                 Default is 13 (8k blocks)
    12      4    sub_blocks	    number of sub-blocks each data block is
                                 subdivided into. Default is 16.
                                 Must be a power of 2.
    16      4    directory_bits  log2 of the number of entries per directory
                                 node. Default is 9 (512 entries)
    20      4    compression	    0 = none, 1 = bz2, 2 = zlib
    24      4    clean           1 if file was cleanly closed, 0 if not
    28      4    reserved
    32      8    free_list       file offset of the start of the free block
                                 list
    40      8    size            size of the address space. This is the size
                                 of the file encoded in the CRAFF file.
    48      8    root            file offset of the root directory block,
                                 or of the (only) data block if 
                                 size &lt;= (1&lt;&lt;block_bits).
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The number of directory levels depends on the size, so that
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">      size &lt;= 2 ** (block_bits + directory_levels * directory_bits)
</pre><p>
   I.e.,
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">   directory_levels =
            max(ceil((ceil(log2(size)) - block_bits) / directory_bits), 0)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   A logical address can be decomposed as follows
   (example shown with directory_levels == 3):
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">bit 63.................................................................0
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
    |  0  |       d0      |       d1      |       d2      |    ofs     |
    +------------------------------------------------------------------+
            directory_bits  directory_bits  directory_bits   block_bits  
</pre><p>
   where d0 is the index into the root directory, d1 into the level 1
   directory, and so on, and ofs the offset within the data block.
</p><p>
   Each data or directory block is stored as one or more fragments, each
   preceded by a fragment header:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Offset  Size     Field      Description
     0     8     size       size of this fragment in bytes, not including
                            this header
     8     8     next       file offset of the next fragment of this
                            logical block, or zero if last
(total size: 16 bytes)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   To read a data or directory block, it is necessary to read each fragment
   and assemble them into a contiguous logical block, stripping the fragment
   headers.
</p><p>
   A logical directory block is preceded by a directory header:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Offset  Size    Field           Description
     0     4    num_entries     number of entries in this directory,
                                always equal to 1 &lt;&lt; directory_bits.
     4     4    reserved
(total size: 8 bytes)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   The directory itself then consists of num_entries directory entries, each
   of which having the following format:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Offset  Size    Field           Description
     0     4    present         1 if block is present, 0 if not
     4     4    reserved
     8     8    block_start     file offset to the block or directory
                                (its first fragment), if present == 1
(total size: 16 bytes)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   Each logical data block is preceded by a sub-block bitmap, whose size is
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">     bitmap_bytes = floor((sub_blocks + 7) / 8)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to a sub-block. The bitmap is in
   little-endian byte and bit order: the Nth sub-block corresponds to bit
   <code>(N % 8)</code> of byte <code>(N / 8)</code> of the bitmap. Each
   sub-block counts as present if its bit is set in the bitmap, and
   absent otherwise.
</p><p>
   Logical directory and data blocks are compressed according to the
   compression field in the file header. For data blocks, the compression
   includes the sub-block bitmap. The fragmentation is done after the
   compression, which is done one logical block at a time.
</p><p>
   The free block list is a linked list of free chunks in the file. Each chunk
   begins the following header:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Offset  Size    Field           Description
     0     8    size            size of chunk in bytes, not including
                                this header
     8     8    next            file offset to next free chunk,
                                or zero if last
(total size: 16 bytes)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   Note that the free list has the same format as the fragment list for each
   logical block. This way, the fragments of a freed logical block can quickly
   be appended to the free list.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Problems-and-improvements">Problems and improvements</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The num_entries field in the directory header is superfluous since it
must be equal to <code>(1&lt;&lt;directory_bits)</code>. This means that
the directory header can be eliminated.
</p><p>
The "present" field of each directory entry can be eliminated by
setting the block_start field to zero if the block is absent. This
would make the directory blocks half as big as before, or double
their capacity, which would reduce the average number of directory
levels and therefore reduce the number of disk accesses.
</p><p>
It would be possible to change this while keeping code for compatibility
with the version 1 format.
</p><p>
In uncompressed files, the fragment list is not used since blocks always
keep their size regardless of content. In this case the fragment headers
could be eliminated, storing logical blocks directly. This would give
a minor space saving and possibly better alignment of blocks to actual
disk blocks, possibly increasing performance.
</p><p>
If sub_blocks is 1, then the sub-block bitmap is not really required
(the single sub-block could always be considered "present").
This would be the common case when a craff file represents memory.
