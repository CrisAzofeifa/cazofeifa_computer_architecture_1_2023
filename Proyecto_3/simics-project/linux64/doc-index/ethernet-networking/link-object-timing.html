<a name="latency"></a>

</p><p>
All frames that are sent over a link are delivered to the receiving devices
after a small delay.  The delay is the same for every frame, and is called the
<em>latency</em> of the link.  Each link object has a <i>goal_latency</i>
configuration parameter that controls the ideal latency the link wants to
obtain.
</p><p>
Link objects are most often used to communicate between network devices using
separate clocks. Due to way how Simics handles simulated time, different clocks
are not always completely synchronized.  In order to avoid indeterministic
simulation, the link latency must be high enough that any data sent over the
link will never reach the recipient at a point in time it has already passed.
This imposes a lower boundary on the latency, called the <em><a name="minimumlatency">minimum
latency</a></em> of the link.  The value of the minimum latency depends on
the simulation setup, in particular whether the simulation is multithreaded or
</p><p>
distributed across several Simics processes.  See chapter "Scaling
Simics" of the <em>Simics User's Guide</em> for more information
about links and latencies.
</p><p>
The latency of a link can be specified in
the <b>create-ethernet-cable/hub/switch</b> command as a time in
seconds. If the latency of a link is set too low, it will be automatically
adjusted to the lowest value allowed by the setup when the component is
instantiated. For example, when creating two instances of
the <i>QSP-x86</i> machine and connecting them to an Ethernet link
with a too low latency, Simics will adjust the latency automatically. Let us
look at an example with the <code>firststeps-multi.simics</code> script. It
uses the <b>new-</b> command to create instantiated components instead of
the <b>create-</b> variant:
</p><p>



</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module eth-links</b>
simics&gt; <b>new-ethernet-hub goal_latency = 0.000001</b>
Created instantiated 'ethernet_hub' component 'ethernet_hub0'
simics&gt; <b>connect board0.mb.sb.eth_slot ethernet_hub0.device0</b>
simics&gt; <b>connect board1.mb.sb.eth_slot ethernet_hub0.device1</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The <em>effective latency</em> of a link can be displayed by the
<b>status</b> command provided by the link object. The actual Ethernet links
are not created until the components are instantiated. To get access to the
Ethernet link implementation, just request the <b>link</b> object in the
component:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>ethernet_hub0.link.status</b>
Status of ethernet_hub0.link [class eth-hub-link]
=================================================

    Effective latency : 10.0 ms

    Connected devices : ('board0.mb.sb.phy', 'board0.cell')
                        ('board1.mb.sb.phy', 'board1.cell')
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Note the higher effective latency the link obtained, despite a goal latency of
1us. The default latency can be adjusted using the <b>set-min-latency</b>
command.
