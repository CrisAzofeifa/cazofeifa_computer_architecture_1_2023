A network simulation can also be connected to a real network. By doing this,
simulated computers and real computers will be able to communicate with each
other.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Timing problems when using a real network connection, such as
TCP timeouts, indicates that the simulation is running too fast: it might be
idle most of the time. In this case, slow it down by using the
<b><a name="enable-real-time-mode">enable-real-time-mode</a></b> command.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Connecting to a real network introduces potential security
risks. See the Installation Guide for more information.</div>Before following the steps in this example, start a new
<code>firststeps.simics</code>. By default, the <code>firststeps.simics</code>
target script creates not only the target machine but also an Ethernet switch
(the <b>ethernet_switch0</b> object of the <b>ethernet_switch</b>
class) and a kind of a router (the <b>service_node_cmp0</b> object of
the <b>service_node_comp</b>).


<p>
Once the target machine is booted, we can see that the simulated machine got IP address
assigned. We use here newer <code>ip</code> command but the legacy <code>ifconfig</code>
command is also available on the target: 
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>ip a</b>

The IP address for the simulated machine was provided though DHCP service
by the <b>service_node_cmp0</b> object. The <b>service_node_cmp0</b>
object allows also to reach the outside world from the simulated machine:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>curl -o index.html www.google.com</b>

</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Corporate networks may require the use of proxies to
connect to external resources. The simulated machine is not an exception.
Thus, reaching external resource from the simulated machine may require
additional configuration of the simulated machine.</div>Often, we would like to reach the simulated machine from the outside world.
This can be done by configuring the <b>service_node_cmp0</b> object to
redirect accesses done to the simulation host ports to the simulated machine.
To achieve this we will use the <b>connect-real-network</b> command.
This command can set up a lot of things: create a new Ethernet switch,
connect it to all simulated network devices as well as to the real network.
In our case most of the things were already set up by
the <code>firststeps.simics</code> target script so
the command will just instruct the <b>service_node_cmp0</b> object to
forward ports 4021, 4022, 4023 and 4080 on the simulation host
to the simulated machine's telnet, SSH, FTP and HTTP ports, respectively.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>connect-real-network</b>
NAPT already enabled.
Host TCP port 4021 -&gt; 10.10.0.100:21
Host TCP port 4022 -&gt; 10.10.0.100:22
Host TCP port 4023 -&gt; 10.10.0.100:23
Host TCP port 4080 -&gt; 10.10.0.100:80
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Note that <b>connect-real-network</b> found out which IP
address to work with by checking configuration variables set
by <code>firststeps.simics</code>. You can also specify this address as
parameter to the command</div>Since <b>connect-real-network</b> has set up forwarding for the ssh, telnet, FTP
and HTTP ports of the simulated machine, it is possible to login to the
simulated machine with ssh command. On your host, try the following:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">host~$ <b>ssh -p 4022 -l root localhost</b>
The authenticity of host '[localhost]:4022 ([127.0.0.1]:4022)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:KcA9xIWuTUKDaTduNWCtxFHGnbRNiOxeFfNaci45MqI.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[localhost]:4022' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.
~# <b>exit</b>

Connection to localhost closed.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Note that if you restart the simulated machine, you may need
to remove the line starting with '[localhost]:4022' in host file
<code>~/.ssh/known_hosts</code> to login with ssh again.</div>You can also access the minimal web server running on the simulated
computer. Point your browser to the following
address: <a class="jdocu" href="http://localhost:4080" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">http://localhost:4080</a>. You should get something similar to
