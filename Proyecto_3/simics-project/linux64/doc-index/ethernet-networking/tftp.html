The service node also supports the <i>Trivial File Transfer Protocol</i> (TFTP,
see <em>RFC 1350</em>) which allows to transfer files between the host
system (running the simulation) and a simulated (target) client. TFTP is often
used during network booting, together with the BOOTP facilities, to load OS
kernels and images, and it can also be used interactively with
the <code>tftp</code> command found on many systems.
</p><p>
Files to be transferred from the host system to the simulated client should be
placed in a directory in the Simics path. This is the standard path used by
image objects: <b>list-directories</b> will print its current value, while
<b>add-directory</b> will add a directory to the path list. The
current working directory is also automatically included.
</p><p>
Files transferred from the simulated client to the host will end up in the
current working directory. When running Simics in graphical mode, this will be
the project directory; from the command line or without a project, it will
be the directory Simics was started from.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
TFTP is based on UDP, and each packet is acknowledged individually before
the transfer is allowed to continue. Depending on the latency of the link, the
transfer of large files can be slow. In that case, ensuring that the link uses
a lower latency will increase performance.</div>A short example, assuming the target machine is running Linux with TFTP
installed, has already booted, and has a working service node properly
connected. We bring up the target's network interface:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer: ~#<b> ifconfig eth0 10.10.0.10 up</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
And we transfer the file <code>myfile.txt</code> from the host machine:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer: ~#<b> tftp -l myfile.txt -r myfile.txt -g 10.10.0.1</b>
</pre><p>
