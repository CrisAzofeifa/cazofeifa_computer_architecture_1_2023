</p><p>
Simics comes with a <b>eth-injector</b> class that takes
a <em>pcap</em> format file and injects the packets described in the file into
the simulated network.
</p><p>
Each packet in a pcap file has a time stamp that usually is the
absolute time when the packet was recorded. The
<b>eth-injector</b> starts injecting the first packet of the pcap file
directly after the <b>start</b> command has been run. The consecutive
packets are injected after an amount of virtual time that is equal to the
difference in time stamp between that packet and the first packet of the pcap
file. If the packet cannot be injected because of bandwidth limitations, it is
ignored. Incoming packets are ignored as well.
</p><p>
It is common that the CRC of Ethernet frames are not recorded in pcap files. In
Simics, the whole Ethernet frame has to be present for a correct simulation
result. The <i>-no-crc</i> option of
the <b>&lt;eth-injector&gt;.start</b> command can be used to tell
the injector that the
pcap file contains no CRC. The injector then adds a CRC to each frame that
Simics will handle as if it was correct. By not using the <i>-no-crc</i>
option the frames in the pcap file are injected as they were recorded, without
any modification.
</p><p>
The <b>eth-injector</b> can be connected to an Ethernet link like any
other Ethernet device. It can also be connected directly to another Ethernet
device without the need to have a link between the device and
the <b>eth-injector</b>.
</p><p>
The following example creates a new <b>eth-injector</b>,
connects it to an already existing <b>ethernet_switch</b> of
name <b>ethernet_switch0</b> and starts packet playback from a
file named <em>test.pcap</em>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module eth-injector-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>new-eth-injector-comp name = inj0</b>
Created instantiated 'eth_injector_comp' component 'inj0'
simics&gt; <b>connect ethernet_switch0.link inj0.link</b>
simics&gt; <b>inj0.injector.start file = test.pcap</b>
</pre><p>
