Connecting simulated machines over a simulated <a name="Ethernet">Ethernet</a> connection
is done by creating a <em>link</em> using one of the components in
the <b>eth-links</b>
module: <b><a name="ethernet-cable">ethernet-cable</a></b>,
<b><a name="ethernet-hub">ethernet-hub</a></b>
or <b><a name="ethernet_switch">ethernet_switch</a></b>. Any of these components can
connect to the Ethernet devices of the simulated machines. They model Ethernet
at the frame level, in that they perform delivery of complete frames sent from
one device to another, and do not model collisions or lower-level signaling
details. Each of the three Ethernet links have their own particularities:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:ethernet_cable"><b>ethernet_cable</b></dt><dd>An Ethernet cable can only be connected to two
devices, since, as a real Ethernet cable, it only has two ends. Apart from
transporting Ethernet frames back and forth, an Ethernet cable models whether
the signal is up or down.</dd><dt id="dt:ethernet_hub"><b>ethernet_hub</b></dt><dd>An ethernet_hub is the simplest Ethernet link model:
all frames are broadcast to all devices connected to the hub. It works like a
traditional hub or coaxial cable.</dd><dt id="dt:ethernet_switch"><b>ethernet_switch</b></dt><dd>An ethernet_switch also allows the connection of
multiple devices, but functions rather like a switch: as it learns what
MAC addresses the different devices have, it stops broadcasting and
transports the frame more selectively. This can substantially improve
simulation performance when several devices are talking on the link,
and even more so when the simulation is distributed.</dd></dl><p>As all three models work more or less at the frame level; they can be used for
any type of Ethernet connection, without limitations due to speed or
technology. Traffic sent over the link can be anything,
including <a name="TCPIP">TCP/IP</a> or any other protocol stack that works on top of
Ethernet. The link does not need to be configured for the intended use.
</p><p>
The three components are provided in the <b><a name="eth-links">eth-links</a></b>
module. They can be manipulated in the same way as any other component: after
importing <b>eth-links</b>,
the <b>create-ethernet-cable/hub/switch</b> commands are made available.
They create non-instantiated components:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module eth-links</b>
simics&gt; <b>create-ethernet-hub</b>
Created non-instantiated 'ethernet-hub' component 'ethernet_hub0'.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The name will be automatically chosen by Simics unless it is provided as an
argument to the command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>create-ethernet-hub my_ethernet_hub</b>
Created non-instantiated 'ethernet-hub' component 'my_ethernet_hub'.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When a link component has been created, it is possible to connect the network
devices by running the <b>connect</b> command for each Ethernet port. For
demonstration, we will use x86 machines from the <em>QSP-x86</em>
package. Start the simulation with the <code>firststeps-multi.simics</code>
start script and run the following commands:
</p><p>



</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module eth-links</b>
simics&gt; <b>create-ethernet-hub my_ethernet_hub</b>
Created non-instantiated 'ethernet_hub' component 'my_ethernet_hub'
simics&gt; <b>connect board0.mb.sb.eth_slot my_ethernet_hub.device0</b>
simics&gt;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To find a connector which is not connected for
<b>ethernet_cable/hub/switch</b> components
the <b>get-free-connector</b> command can be used. This command
returns the name of a free connector:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>my_ethernet_hub.get-free-connector</b>
"my_ethernet_hub.device1"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Together the <b>get-free-connector</b> and <b>connect</b>
commands can be used to connect a Ethernet device to a free connector:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>connect (my_ethernet_hub.get-free-connector) board1.mb.sb.eth_slot</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Now, when all of the components of the system are configured and connected
together, instantiate the link components:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>instantiate-components</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
It is also possible to create instantiated links with the
<b>new-ethernet-cable/hub/switch</b> commands, but note that this only
works if there is already at least one instantiated top-level component in the
simulation.
