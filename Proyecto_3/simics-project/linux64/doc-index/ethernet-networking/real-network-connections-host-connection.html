Simics can connect a simulated network to a virtual Ethernet (TAP)
interface on the simulation host. The simulation host and the
simulated machines will then be able to communicate as if they were
connected to the same Ethernet network. For example, by configuring
the simulation host with an IP address on the TAP interface, the
simulation host and the simulated machines will be able to send IP
traffic to each other.
</p><p>
Enabling IP forwarding on the host will also allow the simulated
machines to access other hosts on the real network, using the host
operating system's IP routing facilities. Read the instructions after
the example below for instructions about how to set it up.
</p><p>
To connect the simulated network to the TAP interface, the TAP
interface should be configured on the simulation host, as described in
section <a class="reference" href="real-network-access-tap.html">4.3.1</a>. Use the
<b>connect-real-network-host</b> command, which simply takes the
name of the TAP interface as the <i>interface</i> argument. The
simulation host will now appear on the simulated network. Configure
the TAP interface of the host with an IP address from the same subnet
as the simulated machines, and the simulated machines will be able to
communicate with the host.
</p><p>
Simulated machine configurations provided with Simics usually use IP
addresses from the 10.10.0.<em>x</em> subnet, so the simulation host
should typically get an IP address on the form 10.10.0.<em>x</em> with a
netmask of 255.255.255.0.
</p><p>
On Linux, this is configured with <code>ifconfig</code>, which requires
administrative privileges:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ifconfig sim_tap0 10.10.0.<em>x</em> netmask 255.255.255.0 up</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
On Windows, use these steps instead:
</p><p>
</p><ol>

    <li>Open the <b>Network Connections</b> folder of the
    <b>Control Panel</b>.</li>

    <li>Right-click on the OpenVPN TAP interface to bring up a context
    menu, and select <em>Properties</em>.</li>

    <li>A property dialog box will open. Select <em>Internet Protocol
    (TCP/IP)</em> and click on the <b>Properties</b> button.</li>

    <li>A new property dialog box will open. Select <b>Use the
    following IP address</b> and enter the <em>IP address</em> and
    <em>Subnet mask</em> the simulation host should use on the
    simulated network.
<p>
    Select an IP address on the form 10.10.0.<em>x</em> and the netmask
    255.255.255.0. The <em>Default gateway</em> field can typically be
    left blank.</p></li>

    <li>Click <b>OK</b> in both property dialog boxes.</li>

</ol>
<p>

</p><p>
This example assumes that the simulation is starting from the
checkpoint prepared in section <a class="reference" href="real-network-examples.html">4.1</a>,
that there is a correctly set up TAP interface on the simulation host
for host connection according to section <a class="reference" href="real-network-access-tap.html">4.3.1</a>, and that it has been configured
with the IP address 10.10.0.1 as described above. Here the name if
the TAP interface is assumed to be <code>sim_tap0</code>: replace it with
the name of the TAP interface.
</p><p>
To connect the TAP interface to the simulated network, use the
<b>connect-real-network-host</b> command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>connect-real-network-host interface = sim_tap0</b>
No Ethernet link found, created default_eth_switch0.
Connected board.mb.sb.eth_slot to default_eth_switch0
[rn0.rn info] Connecting to TAP device 'sim_tap0'
'default_eth_switch0' connected to real network.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
On Windows, the message "Connecting to existing TUN/TAP device
'sim_tap0'" will not appear.</div>Any kind of Ethernet traffic can now pass between the simulated
network and the simulation host. It should be possible, for example,
to ping the simulation host from the simulated machine, at the IP
address configured on the TAP interface:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>ping 10.10.0.1 -c 5</b>

</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="real-network-connections-host-connection-ip-forwarding">IP Forwarding</a></h2>
<p>
     
</p><p>
Enabling IP forwarding on the simulation host will allow real machines
to access the simulated network by routing the traffic through the
simulation host. This method is called <em> <a name="IPforwarding"></a>IP
forwarding</em>.
</p><p>
On Linux run the following command to set up ip forwarding:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1</b>
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 1
</pre><p>
</p><p>
And to disable IP forwarding again:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=0</b>
net.ipv4.ip_forward = 0
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To set it up on Windows, change the registry key
<code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\IPEnableRouter</code>
from 0 to 1 and reboot. If the key does not exist, create it and give
it the value 1. To disable IP forwarding, reset the registry key to 0
and reboot.
</p><p>
For the routing to work, both the simulated machines and the machines
on the real network must be configured: on the simulated machines, a
route must be added to the real network with the IP address of the
host's TAP interface as gateway; on the real machines, it is a route
to the simulated network with the IP address of the simulation host's
Ethernet interface that should be added.
