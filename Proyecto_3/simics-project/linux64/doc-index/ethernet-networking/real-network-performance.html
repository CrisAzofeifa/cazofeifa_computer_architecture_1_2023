When using other connection types than port forwarding, Simics has to prevent
the simulated network from being flooded with packets from the real network. In
practice, the simulated machine is not always able to handle the amount of
traffic it receives, and Simics cannot buffer all incoming packets. This is
especially a problem when the simulation is stopped.
</p><p>
Flooding is prevented by limiting the amount of traffic that is allowed to
enter the simulated network per simulated second. This amount is determined by
the <i>tx_bandwidth</i> and <i>tx_packet_rate</i> attributes of the
real network object created for the connection, typically
named <b>real_net0</b>. The unit of the <i>tx_bandwidth</i> attribute
is bits per simulated second, and the unit of the <i>tx_packet_rate</i>
attribute is packets per simulated second. Either can be set to unlimited by
setting them to 0, but this is not recommended unless a very limited amount of
data is to be received. The default is to allow 10 megabits per simulated
second and an unlimited number of packets.
</p><p>
In addition to allowing the selected rate of traffic into the simulated
network, Simics buffers traffic for an additional 0.1 seconds of simulated
time, to avoid dropping packets during a short peak in the traffic. If more
packets arrive once this buffer is full, Simics will drop them.
</p><p>
To get better performance out of the connection to the real network, modify the
value of the <i>tx_bandwidth</i> and <i>tx_packet_rate</i>
attributes until satisfied. A good strategy is to set the
<i>tx_bandwidth</i> attribute to the amount of traffic that the simulated
machine is expected to handle per simulated second, and then try to increase
the <i>tx_packet_rate</i> from about 5000 and see at what packet rate the
best performance is achieved.
</p><p>
For example, this will set the limit to 100 megabits and 10000 packets per
simulated second:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>@conf.real_net0.tx_bandwidth = 100000000</b>
simics&gt; <b>@conf.real_net0.tx_packet_rate = 10000</b>
</pre><p>
