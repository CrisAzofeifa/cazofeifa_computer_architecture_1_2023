<p>

</p><p>
There are three kinds of connections between simulated networks and real
networks in Simics. The next paragraphs describe how they work, and their
advantages and drawbacks.
</p><p>
All connection types except port forwarding require low-level access to the
simulation host's Ethernet interfaces, and therefore require administrative
privileges to set up. However, administrative privileges are, in most
cases, not needed once the low-level access has been set
up. See section <a class="reference" href="real-network-access.html">4.3</a> for details.
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:port-forwarding"><b><a name="port-forwarding"></a>Port forwarding</b></dt><dd>Port forwarding is the easiest connection type to set up for
    simple usage. It does not require administrative privileges nor
    any configuration on the simulation host or on the other
    hosts.
<p>
    However, port forwarding is limited to TCP and UDP traffic. Other
    traffic, for example, ping packets that use the <a name="ICMP">ICMP</a>
    protocol, will not pass through the connection. Since port
    forwarding uses ports on the simulation host it is not possible to
    use incoming ports that are already used by the simulation host,
    or ports below 1024 without administrative privileges.
</p><p>
    Each incoming TCP port, and each incoming or outgoing UDP port
    require a separate forwarding rule. Therefore, for an application
    that uses many ports, or random ports, configuration can become
    cumbersome or nearly impossible without complex
    communication. Outgoing TCP connections on many or random ports
    can be handled by NAPT, so that is not a problem.
</p><p>
    Port forwarding allows communication between the simulated
    machines, the simulation host and other hosts on the real
    network.</p></dd><dt id="dt:ethernet-bridging-connection"><b><a name="Ethernetbridging"></a> <a name="bridging"></a> Ethernet
		bridging connection</b></dt><dd>With an Ethernet bridging connection, the simulated machines
    appears to be directly connected to the real network. The
    connection allows any kind of Ethernet traffic between the
    simulated and real networks. Usually IP addresses from the IP
    subnet of the real network are used by the simulated machines, in
    which case nothing needs to be configured on the real hosts on the
    real network. However, the simulation host can not be accessed
    from the simulated machines using an Ethernet bridging connection.
<p>
    To use Ethernet bridging, the simulation host needs to be set up
    for <a name="bridgingTAP"></a> TAP access as described in section
    <a class="reference" href="real-network-access.html">4.3</a>.
</p><p>
    </p></dd><dt id="dt:host-connection"><b><a name="host-connection"></a> Host connection</b></dt><dd>With a host connection, the simulation host is connected to a
    simulated network, allowing any kind of Ethernet traffic between
    the simulation host and the simulated machines.
<p>
    Host connections also supports <em><a name="IPforwarding"></a>IP
    forwarding</em>. When using IP forwarding, the operating system of
    the host routes IP traffic between the real and simulated
    networks. As above, routes should be configured between the
    simulated and real networks to make it work.
</p><p>
    To use host connections, the host needs to be set up for
    <a name="bridgingTAP2"></a> TAP access as described in section <a class="reference" href="real-network-access-tap.html">4.3.1</a>.
</p><p>
    </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
A raw packet with length X bytes sent from the simulation host
    through the real network device into the simulated target will have
    4 Bytes of FCS(frame check sequence) appended. The target machine will
    actually receive a packet of length X+4 bytes. The NIC model on the
    target machine usually checks and strips the FCS bytes before it is
    seen by any software. A raw packet that originates from the target
    will have an FCS calculated and appended by the NIC model. The real
    network device will then check the FCS and strip it before sending to
    the simulation host interface (TAP interface).</div></dd></dl><p></p><div class="figure" id="compare-rn-cnts">

The table <a class="reference" href="#compare-rn-cnts">2</a> recapitulates the advantages
and drawbacks of each type of connection. Basically, for simple TCP
services like <a name="FTP">FTP</a>, <a name="HTTP">HTTP</a> or <a name="telnet">telnet</a>,
<a name="port-forwarding2">port forwarding</a> is the way to go. If port forwarding does
not suffice and if there are available IP addresses on the IP subnet
of the real network, or for network protocols other than IPv4,
Ethernet bridging <a name="Ethernetbridging2"></a> is another possibility.
Finally, if access to the simulated machines from
the simulation host is required, but port forwarding is not
sufficient, <a name="host-connection2">host connection</a> might be the solution.
</p><p>
All commands that create a connection to the real network start with
the prefix <b><a name="connect-real-network-">connect-real-network-</a></b>, with different
suffixes depending on the connection type. They come in two variants.
</p><p>
For each connection type there is a global command that assumes that
there is at most one <a name="Ethernet-linkethernet-link"></a>Ethernet
link object. If there is no Ethernet link object, a default
<b>ethernet_switch</b> is created. All Ethernet interfaces of
all simulated machines in the Simics process are then automatically
connected to the new Ethernet switch, and the Ethernet switch is
connected to the real network. This is an easy way to connect all
simulated machines in the Simics process to the real network with a
single command. For example, to connect all simulated machines to the
real network using an Ethernet bridging connection, just type in the
global command <b>connect-real-network-bridge</b>.
</p><p>
For a more complex simulated network setup, not all simulated Ethernet
interfaces will be connected to the same network. In that case, create
first the simulated network setup, and then connect specific Ethernet
links to the real network. For each connection type, there is a
command with the same name as the global command that can be run on a
specific Ethernet link object to connect it to the real network. For
example, with an Ethernet link object named <b>ethernet_hub0</b>,
use the command <b>ethernet_hub0.connect-real-network-bridge</b>
to create an Ethernet bridging connection between that particular link
and the real network.
</p><p>
The commands related to port forwarding are an exception to this
rule. They do not come in variants that can be run on Ethernet links
objects, but instead have an <i>ethernet-link</i> argument that
can be used to specify a link.
