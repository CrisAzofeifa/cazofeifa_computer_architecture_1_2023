<p>
   <a name="port-forwarding"></a>
</p><p>
Port forwarding forwards traffic on TCP and UDP ports between the
simulated network and the real network. It also allows forwarding DNS
queries from the simulated network to the real network. Port
forwarding can be used with any kind of IP network on the host, it is
not limited to Ethernet networks.
</p><p>
Port forwarding is probably the easiest way to access the real network
for simple <a name="TCPIP"></a>TCP or <a name="UDP">UDP</a> connectivity, for
example, <a name="telnet">telnet</a> or FTP usage. Port forwarding is easy to
set up. Simics does not need administrative privileges to run port
forwarding, and neither the simulation host nor any other host needs
to be configured in any way.
</p><p>
Port forwarding is managed by a <a name="service-node"></a> service node
connected to an Ethernet link. It is the service node that listens for
traffic on both the real and simulated networks and forwards it to the
other side.  All port forwarding commands except
<b>connect-real-network</b> therefore take as argument an Ethernet
link with a connected service node.
</p><p>
There are really four distinct parts to Simics's port forwarding
solution: <a name="port-forwardingincoming"></a> forwarding of specific
ports from the real network to the simulated network, <a name="portforwardingoutgoing"></a> forwarding of specific ports from the
simulated network to the real network, <a name="port-forwardingNAPT"></a>
<a name="NAPT">NAPT</a> from the simulated network to the real network, and
forwarding of <a name="DNS">DNS</a> queries to the real network.
</p><p>
There is also a convenience command named <a name="portforwardingconnect-real-network"></a>
<b><a name="connect-real-network">connect-real-network</a></b> that automatically sets up
NAPT for outgoing traffic, forwarding of DNS queries to the real
network, and incoming port forwarding for some common services.  If
there is no Ethernet link object, one is created and set up.
</p><p>
The <a name="port-forwardinglist-port-forwarding-setup"></a>
<b>list-port-forwarding-setup</b> command describes the current
port forwarding setup: it will list all incoming and outgoing ports,
as well as the NAPT and DNS forwarding status.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
<a name="Ping"></a>Pinging between the simulated network and the
real network will not work when using port forwarding, so ping should
not be used to test if the connection is working. Ping uses the
<a name="ICMP">ICMP</a> protocol, but only TCP and UDP traffic is supported
with port forwarding.</div><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="real-network-connections-port-forwarding-crn">The connect-real-network Command</a></h2>
<p><a name="connect-real-network2"></a> The <b>connect-real-network</b>
command is a convenience command that sets up <a name="NAPT2">NAPT</a> for
outgoing traffic, enables forwarding of DNS queries to the real
network, and opens incoming ports for FTP, HTTP and telnet to a
simulated machine. This is an easy way to get inbound and outbound
access for common services on a simulated machine.
</p><p>
The command requires a <i>target-ip</i> argument that specifies
the IP address of the simulated machine that should be targeted by the
incoming traffic. If there are multiple simulated machines,
<b>connect-real-network</b> can be run once for each
machine. Simics will select different ports on the simulation host for
the incoming services for each simulated machine, and the selected
ports are printed in the Simics console.
</p><p>
The <b>connect-real-network</b> command does not require an
Ethernet link as argument, unless there is more than one in the
simulation. If there is no Ethernet link or service node, they will be
created automatically.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="real-network-connections-port-forwarding-crn-example">Example</a></h3>
<p>
     
</p><p>
The <b>connect-real-network</b> allows us to set up all
connections that are needed for most simple real network uses with one
simple command. We can start from the checkpoint prepared in section
<a class="reference" href="real-network-examples.html">4.1</a>, and then run the
<b>connect-real-network</b> command with the IP address 10.10.0.40, which
is the default address of <i>QSP-x86</i>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>connect-real-network 10.10.0.40</b>

</pre><p>
</p><p>
The output shows that an <b>ethernet_switch</b> and a
<b>service_node_comp</b> components have been automatically
created and connected to the simulated machine. NAPT, DNS forwarding,
and incoming port forwarding for FTP, HTTP and telnet have also been
enabled.
</p><p>
Now start the simulation. Since we gave the service node the IP
address 10.10.0.1, <i>QSP-x86</i> should be configured with
10.10.0.1 as default gateway:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>route add default gw 10.10.0.1</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
It should now be possible to telnet from the simulated machine to
hosts on the real network. In this case, we telnet to a Solaris
machine with IP address 10.0.0.240; replace this address with any host
answering to telnet on the network:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>telnet 10.0.0.240</b>

<i>QSP-x86</i> can be configured to use the service node as
DNS server and use it to look up real DNS names. To do that, add the
line <code>nameserver 10.10.0.1</code> in the file
<code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> on the simulated machine:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>echo nameserver 10.10.0.1 &gt; /etc/resolv.conf</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
It should now be possible to look up the addresses of real hosts on
the simulated machine, for example,
<a class="jdocu" href="https://gnu.org" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">https://gnu.org</a>. <i>QSP-x86</i> does not have the tools
to perform DNS lookups. Instead, verify that DNS works by connecting
to a real server by name:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>telnet gnu.org 80</b>

</pre><p>
</p><p>
FTP, HTTP and telnet servers running on the simulated machine should
also be accessible. <i>QSP-x86</i> runs both a telnet and a
HTTP server. Just use port 4023 and 4080 instead of 23 and 80. The
exact ports of the host these services are mapped to varies if the
default ports are already in use. Look at the output from the
<b>connect-real-network</b> above for the port numbers to use.
</p><p>

</p><p>
 </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="real-network-connections-port-forwarding-crnpi">Incoming Port Forwarding</a></h2>
<p>
     
</p><p>
<a name="port-forwardingincoming2"></a>
<a name="connect-real-networkconnect-real-network-port-in"></a> The
<b>connect-real-network-port-in</b> command sets up port
forwarding from a port on the host machine to a specific port on a
simulated machine. It takes three required arguments:
<i>ethernet-link</i>, <i>target-ip</i> and
<i>target-port</i>, that specify the Ethernet link, IP address and
port the traffic should be forwarded to.
</p><p>
An IP address and preferred port can be selected for incoming traffic
on the simulation host using the <i>host-ip</i> and
<i>host-port</i> arguments. If these arguments are not provided,
Simics will select a port automatically and print it on the Simics
console, and receive all IPv4 traffic (i.e., IP 0.0.0.0) from that
port. In order to forward multicast traffic, specify that multicast
address (e.g., specify 239.255.255.253 to forward IPv4 SLP traffic).
</p><p>
The <b>connect-real-network-port-in</b> command can also take the
flags <i>-tcp</i> and <i>-udp</i>, which specify whether
forwarding is set up for a TCP or a UDP port. If neither is provided,
forwarding will be set up for both the TCP and UDP ports.
</p><p>
The service node acts as a proxy for incoming traffic, so to initiate
a connection to a specific port on the simulated machine, the real
machine should contact the corresponding open port on the simulation
host. The simulation host is not a gateway to the simulated network.
</p><p>
Any UDP packets sent to a port on the simulation host are forwarded to
the specified port and IP address on the simulated network. For the
simulated machine to be able to return UDP packets to the real
network, a separate forwarding rule must be set up using the
<a name="connect-real-networkconnect-real-network-port-out"></a>
<b>connect-real-network-port-out</b> command.
</p><p>
Any TCP connections to the port on the simulation host are forwarded
to the specified port and IP address on the simulated network. Since
TCP connections are two-ways, once a connection has been established,
data can be sent in both directions.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
You will probably have to manually add the incoming ports to
your host based software firewall if you want to access the simulated
network from another machine. Tracking down network problems when you
forget to update the firewall is annoying as the packets tend to get
dropped silently without a log.</div><a name="FTPactive-mode"></a> The FTP protocol needs to open additional
ports when transferring files. Simics handles this by automatically
opening outgoing ports for FTP when needed, so FTP will work as long
as it is in <em>active</em> mode.

<p>
      <a name="NAPT3"></a> <a name="NAT"></a>
</p><p>
The <b>connect-real-network-napt</b> command sets up <em>NAPT</em>
(<em>network address port translation</em>, also known as just
<em>NAT</em> or <em>network address translation</em>) between the
simulated network and the real network. With NAPT enabled, the service
node will act as a gateway on the simulated network and automatically
mediate TCP connections to the real network.
</p><p>
The <b>connect-real-network-napt</b> only has one required
argument, <i>ethernet-link</i>, that specifies the Ethernet link
that should be connected to the real network.
</p><p>
The simulated machines must be configured to use the service node as
gateway for the real network, so that it is able to capture the
outgoing traffic. The simulated machines will then be able to access
hosts on the real network using their real IP addresses. By combining
NAPT with DNS forwarding, described in section <a href="#real-network-connections-port-forwarding-crndns">DNS Forwarding</a>, the real
DNS names of hosts on the real network can be used as well.
</p><p>
The NAPT setup is not specific to a simulated machine, so
<b>connect-real-network-napt</b> needs only to run once for each
Ethernet link, and all simulated machines on the link get outbound
access.
</p><p>
Since NAPT only allows new TCP connections to be opened from the
simulated network to the real network, and the FTP protocol need to
open new ports when transferring files, <em>passive</em> mode FTP
should be used when connecting to an FTP server on a host on the real
network from a simulated machine. An alternative is to use the FTP
server implemented in the Simics service-node and avoid the need to
connect to a real network.
