Simics can act as a bridge between simulated Ethernet networks and the
real Ethernet networks of the host. With this type of connection, the
simulated machines will appear as directly connected to the real
network, both to the simulated machines and to the hosts on the real
network. For that reason, the simulated machines should be configured
with IP addresses from the same subnet as the real hosts.
</p><p>
Since the simulated machines appear to be located on the real network,
there is no need to configure routes on real hosts that communicate
with it. They can find the simulated machines by sending ARP requests,
just like they would find other real hosts.
</p><p>
When using a bridged connection, it is recommended to use a dedicated
host network interface for the bridge, not the interface that the host
uses for general network access. Otherwise,
special configuration of the bridge interface is necessary for any
kind of network access for the host. The details about this
configuration will not be covered in this manual. See section
<a class="reference" href="real-network-access.html">4.3</a> for how to set up <a name="TAP">TAP</a>
access.
</p><p>
To create a bridged connection to the real network, use the
<b>connect-real-network-bridge</b> command. It takes an
<i>interface</i> argument that specifies which host TAP interface that
should be used.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="real-network-connections-ethernet-bridging-example">4.2.2.1 Example</a></h2>
<p>
     
</p><p>
This example assumes that the simulation is starting from the
checkpoint prepared in section <a class="reference" href="real-network-examples.html">4.1</a>,
and that a TAP bridge has been set up as described in section
<a class="reference" href="#real-network-connections-ethernet-bridging-tap">4.2.2.2</a>.
</p><p>
To set up an Ethernet bridging connection between the real network and
the simulated network, run the <b>connect-real-network-bridge</b>
command. This will automatically create an Ethernet link, connect it
to the simulated machine and set up bridging to the real network:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>connect-real-network-bridge</b>
No Ethernet link found, created default_eth_switch0.
Connected board.mb.sb.eth_slot to default_eth_switch0
[rn0.rn info] Connecting to existing TAP device 'sim_tap0'
'default_eth_switch0' connected to real network.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When using Ethernet bridging, the simulated machine should be
configured with an unused IP address and netmask from the real
network. In this case we use 10.0.0.241 and 255.255.255.0. Replace it
with an unused IP address and netmask from the real network:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>ifconfig eth0 10.0.0.241 netmask 255.255.255.0</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
As the target machine will appear as a real machine in the net, its gateway and
DNS server should be correctly set according to the host settings, this step
can be verified through pinging the gateway and DNS server IP.
In some corner conditions, it's worth trying to reset (disable and then enable)
the target Ethernet adapter if the gateway or DNS server are unreachable.
</div>The simulated machine is now connected to the real network. Any kind
of IP traffic is bridged between the simulated network and the real
network. It should be possible to ping any real host from the
simulated machine. Replace <em>10.0.0.240</em> with the address of a
host on the real network:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>ping 10.0.0.240 -c 3</b>
PING 10.0.0.240 (10.0.0.240): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 10.0.0.240: seq=0 ttl=64 time=10.285 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.240: seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.349 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.240: seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.323 ms

--- 10.0.0.240 ping statistics ---
3 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 0% packet loss
round-trip min/avg/max = 0.323/3.652/10.285 ms
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Of course, it should also be possible to ping the simulated machine
from the real host.
</p><p>
Running <code>traceroute</code> on the simulated machine shows that it is
connected directly to the real network; there are no routers between
it and the real host. Again, replace <em>10.0.0.240</em> with a host
on the real network:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~# <b>traceroute 10.0.0.240</b>
traceroute to 10.0.0.240 (10.0.0.240), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets
 1  10.0.0.240 (10.0.0.240)  10.106 ms  0.371 ms  0.347 ms
</pre><p>
</p><p>
If the IP address of the simulated machine itself is printed and
<code>!H</code> is printed after the response times, it means the
simulated machine can not reach the real host, and the configuration
is incorrect.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="real-network-connections-ethernet-bridging-tap">4.2.2.2 Setting up TAP for Ethernet Bridging</a></h2>
<p>
     
</p><p>
To use TAP access with the <b>connect-real-network-bridge</b>
command, the operating system must be configured to act as a bridge
between the virtual interface and the real interface. Follow the steps
below to set it up.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
When setting up bridging between a TAP interface and a real
Ethernet interface, the host will no longer accept traffic on the real
interface. All connections the host has open on the interface will be
lost. One consequence of this is that if this is being done from a
remote console, the connection might be lost before the bridge is
fully configured. We therefore strongly recommend that bridging is
only set up on dedicated host interfaces.</div><b>Linux:</b>
<p>
</p><ol>

    <li>Create a TAP interface, as described in section <a class="reference" href="real-network-access-tap.html">4.3.1</a></li>

    <li>Create a bridge interface and connect the TAP interface and
    the real interface. Turn off STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) in the
    bridge as well, otherwise there will be STP traffic from the
    bridge into both the simulated and the real network. Here the name
    of the created bridge interface is <code>sim_br0</code> and the
    interface used is <code>eth1</code>, but other names and interfaces
    can be used.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b><a name="brctl">brctl</a> addbr sim_br0</b>
computer# <b>brctl addif sim_br0 sim_tap0</b>
computer# <b>brctl addif sim_br0 eth1</b>
computer# <b>brctl stp sim_br0 off</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

    <li>Bring up the TAP interface and the bridge interface.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ifconfig sim_tap0 promisc up</b>
computer# <b>ifconfig sim_br0 promisc up</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

    <li>Bring up the Ethernet interface.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ifconfig eth1 up</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

</ol>
<p>
To remove the bridging when finished, do the following:
</p><p>
</p><ol>

    <li>Bring down the TAP interface and the bridge interface.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ifconfig sim_tap0 down</b>
computer# <b>ifconfig sim_br0 down</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

    <li>Delete the bridge interface.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>brctl delbr sim_br0</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

</ol>
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The <code><a name="brctl2">brctl</a></code> utility is usually not present in
default Linux installations. It is usually included in the
<code>bridge-utils</code> package.</div><b>Windows:</b>
<p>
</p><ol>

    <li>Open the <b>Network Connections</b> folder of
      <b>Control Panel</b>.
    </li>

    <li>Select the OpenVPN TAP interface and the real interface to
    bridge to at the same time.</li>

    <li>Right-click on the OpenVPN TAP interface to bring up a context
    menu, and select <em>Bridge Connections</em>.</li>

</ol>
<p>
Windows will now set up bridging between the OpenVPN TAP interface and
the real interface. If successful both the OpenVPN TAP and real
interfaces will seem to disappear as they are now contained in the new
bridge interface. To undo the bridging, go to the <em>Network
Connections</em> folder, right-click on the bridge and select
<em>Delete</em>.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Perhaps you want to disable the spanning tree algorithm (STA). To do that
  you must add or edit the <b>DisableSTA</b> registry key to <code>1</code>.
  Disabling STA will minimize the time to allow packages over the bridge.
  Rebooting Windows is required.<br>
  Windows 7 has the key at<br>
  <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<b>BridgeMP</b>\DisableSTA</code>
  while Windows 10 and later has the key at<br>
  <code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\<b>MsBridge</b>\DisableSTA</code>.
