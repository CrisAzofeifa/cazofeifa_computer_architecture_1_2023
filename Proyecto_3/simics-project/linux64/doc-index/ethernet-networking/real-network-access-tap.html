With TAP access Simics will connect the simulated network to a virtual
Ethernet (TAP) interface provided by the operating system. Accessing
the TAP interface does not require administrative privileges, so once
the TAP interface has been configured, Simics can connect to the real
network without administrative privileges.
</p><p>
The TAP interface can either be bridged to a real Ethernet interface
to create an Ethernet bridging connection, or configured with an IP
address to create a host connection. This section only describes the
basic configuration which is required for both kinds of
connections. Read section <a class="reference" href="real-network-connections-ethernet-bridging.html">4.2.2</a> for the
additional steps needed for Ethernet bridging connections and <a class="reference" href="real-network-connections-host-connection.html">4.2.3</a> for the additional
steps required for host connections.
</p><p>
The setup required for TAP access differs for simulation hosts running
Linux and Windows.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Linux">Linux</a></h2>
<p> 
</p><p>
Creating a TAP interface that Simics can use is done in two simple
steps. These commands require administrative privileges:
</p><p>
</p><ol>

    <li>Give the user running the simulation access to the
    <code>/dev/net/tun</code> device.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>chmod a+rw /dev/net/tun</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

   <li>Create the TAP interface. Here the name of the user that will
   be using the TAP interface is assumed to be <code>joe</code> and the
   name of the TAP interface will be <code>sim_tap0</code>, but it should
   of course be replaced with the correct user name and TAP interface.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ip tuntap add sim_tap0 mode tap user joe</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

   <li>Bring up the interface. (Optional in some environments.)
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ip link set dev sim_tap0 up</b>
</pre><p></p></li>

</ol>
<p>
To remove a TAP interface, do the following (requires
administrative privileges):
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">computer# <b>ip tuntap del mode tap name sim_tap0</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Windows">Windows</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Tow create a TAP interface, a <em>TAP</em> driver is required. One such
is available from the OpenVPN project. See the <em>Installation
Guide</em> for information about how to do this.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Simics uses the MAC addresses of the simulation host's network
interfaces to identify the host for licensing purposes. The licensing
system does not differentiate TAP interfaces and real Ethernet
interfaces. Creating or removing TAP interfaces may therefore
cause a node-locked license to stop working. Renaming the TAP device
so that the Local Area Connection is first will probably fix
this.</div>Configuring a TAP interface consists of setting its name and IP
address.
<p>
</p><ol>
    <li>In the <b>Control Panel</b>, find <b>Network
      Connections.</b>
    </li>

    <li>Rename the new TAP interface if you like to, for example to
      "TAP".
    </li>

     <li>To configure the IP address, right click the TAP device and
     choose Properties, then select "Internet Protocol(TCP/IP)" and
     click the "Properties" button. Some values are 10.10.0.100 for
     the IP address and 255.255.255.0 for the Subnet Mask.</li>

     <li>Click "OK" twice to save the new configuration</li>
</ol>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="TAP-devices-with-multiple-users-and-simulations">TAP devices with multiple users and simulations</a></h2>
<p> 
</p><p>
On Windows, TAP devices are typically created with sufficient
permissions for all users to be able to access them. On Linux however,
you have to be the user or belong to the group that was specified when
the device was created to be able to access it . On both Windows and
Linux, each device can only be opened by one application at a
time. These facts can lead to problems when multiple users tries to
run the same Simics configuration on the same machine, possibly even
at the same time.
</p><p>
Let us take a closer look at how to solve the problem with having
multiple users running identical configurations on the same machine,
but not necessarily at the same time:
</p><p>
Newer versions of the Linux kernel offers the possibility to assign a
group to a TAP device; any member of that group is allowed to open the
tap device, and no further configuration is needed. That means that
any routing table entries that has been set up on the simulation host
has to be configured only once and can remain the same after that.
Without the group functionality of TAP devices, each user must use its
own TAP device. This means that the interface argument to
<b>connect-real-network-[host,bridge]</b> must depend on which
user that runs the command, and routes on the simulation host must be
updated to match that TAP device.
As has previously been said, TAP devices on Windows can typically be
accessed by all users, so the choice of having one or multiple TAP
devices is entirely up to the users.
</p><p>
If several users needs to run identical configurations at the same
time with access to the same real network it gets even more
complicated; the simple answer is that it is generally not possible.
Even if the users run the configuration on different simulation hosts,
it is generally not possible connect both simulations to the real
network in a correct and working manner.
The reasons are a little different between a host connection and a
bridged connection, but in both cases it has to do with the fact
that there are multiple target machines that have the same IP and MAC
addresses on connected to the real network in some way.
</p><p>
When using a bridged real network connection, the simulated network
will appear to be the same network as the real one. When
running two identical simulations, both MAC and IP addresses will be
duplicated on the same network, which will lead to unexpected behavior
even if different simulation hosts are used.
When using a host connection the simulation host can only route
traffic to one of the simulated networks since the network addresses
and TAP interface addresses has to be the same for both
simulations.
The only possible setup is a host connection where each simulation is
running on a different machine, and the only communication is
internally on the simulated network and between simulated machines and
their simulation host.
</p><p>
The general solution to this problem is to use configurations that are
not completely identical. Each simultaneously running configuration
should have unique network properties, such as IP address range, MAC
address range and TAP interface. Using such Simics configurations, all
network configuration, including routes and TAP interfaces on the real
hosts can be done in advance and does not have to be changed for every
Simics configuration that is started. For example, if a bridged
connection is required, several TAP interfaces and a real network
interface can be bridged together to form a single bridge.
</p><p>
The examples below show how real network connections can be configured
when running multiple <em>almost</em> identical Simics configurations
simultaneously. For both examples, the part of the configuration that
has to be done by the root user can be done once so that the user
running the simulation does not need administrative privileges.
</p><p>
Figure <a class="reference" href="#multihost">3</a> shows a setup with two Simics
processes on the same simulation host, both using a host
connection. Each Simics process connects to its own TAP device. All
target machines in the <code>Simics 0</code> configuration has IP
addresses on the 10.10.x.0 network while the <code>Simics 1</code>
configuration has IP addresses on the 10.10.y.0 network. It is
important that all the real hosts that the target machines needs to
talk to has static routes set up for the 10.10.x.0 and 10.10.y.0
networks, using the simulation host as gateway.

<p>
Figure <a class="reference" href="#multibridge">4</a> shows a setup similar to Figure <a class="reference" href="#multihost">3</a>. In this case the target machine connect to the
real network using an Ethernet bridge on the simulation host. The
bridge is invisible to both the target machines and the real hosts. As
all IP addresses must be on the 192.168.0.0 network, the <code>Simics
0</code> configuration uses IP addresses between 192.168.0.0 and
192.168.0.9, and the <code>Simics 1</code> configuration uses IP addresses
between 192.168.0.10 and 192.168.0.19. Note that both
<code>sim_tap0</code> and <code>sim_tap1</code> is part of the same Ethernet
bridge, and that none of the interfaces that is a part of the bridge
has any IP address. In this description the MAC addresses has been
left out to not unnecessarily clutter the figure and
description. These needs to be partitioned between the two Simics
configurations in the same way as the IP addresses.
