A network monitoring tool such as <em>Wireshark</em> (formerly known
as <em>Ethereal</em>) is invaluable when debugging problems with the real
network connections. It is a graphical traffic analyzer that can analyze most
common network protocols. Wireshark is available
from <a class="jdocu" href="http://www.wireshark.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">http://www.wireshark.com</a>.

There are some pitfalls one might encounter when trying to connect a simulated
network to a real one:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:trying-to-access-the-simulation-host"><b>Trying to access the simulation host</b></dt><dd>Accessing the simulation host from the simulated network, or the other
    way around, is only supported with port forwarding and host connection. It
    is difficult—sometimes impossible—to access the simulation host
    from the simulated network when setting up an Ethernet bridging
    connection.</dd><dt id="dt:simulated-os-has-no-route"><b>Simulated OS has no route</b></dt><dd>When using a NAPT connection and the
    operating system of the simulated machine does not have a correct route to
    the real network, the simulated machine will drop the packets or send them
    to the wrong address. To view the routing setup on the simulated machine,
    use the command <code>netstat -r</code> on Linux or <code>route
    print</code> on Windows. Note that these commands should be executed on the
    <i>simulated</i> machines. The simulated OS should have a default route to
    the service node.</dd><dt id="dt:simics-uses-the-wrong-host-network-interface"><b>Simics uses the wrong host network interface</b></dt><dd>On a host with multiple network interfaces installed, Simics will only
    use one of them for a real network connection. If the default selection is
    incorrect, use the <i>interface</i> argument of the connect command to
    select the desired network interface. See the <em>Selecting Host
    Interface</em> part of section <a class="reference" href="real-network-interface.html">4.4</a>.</dd></dl><p></p>
