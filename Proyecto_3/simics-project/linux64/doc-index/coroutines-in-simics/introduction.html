<h1 id="introduction">1 <a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h1>
<p>Coroutines are a language mechanism that allows suspension and resumption of a
subroutine. Coroutines are a useful tool when writing tests for target
software, since it allows test logic to be expressed in a linear manner,
typically by waiting for the system to enter a particular state, inject a
stimuli, awaiting a reaction and validate that reaction.</p>
<p>The recommended way to implement coroutines in the Python language is through
the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax, and the <code>asyncio</code> library.</p>
<p>This document presents two libraries that together leverage <code>asyncio</code>-style
Python coroutines in Simics: The <em><code>snoop</code></em> library, which provides a unified
representation of simulation events, and the <em><code>sloop</code></em> library which allows
snoopers to be used within <code>asyncio</code>.</p>
<h2 id="snoopers">1.1 <a href="#snoopers">Snoopers</a></h2>
<p>A <em>snooper</em> is a Python object responsible for monitoring a particular
kind of simulation event. Snoopers offer a unified API for registering
callbacks.</p>
<p>The primary operation of a snooper is its <code>add_callback</code> method, which
registers a callback on the snooped event. The callback will then be called
repeatedly until it is <em>canceled</em>, which is done by calling the <code>cancel</code> method
on the <code>Handle</code> object returned by <code>add_callback</code>. The <code>add_callback</code> method is
typically not called directly; for most use cases there are utilities
that manage things like cancellations automatically in a safe manner.</p>
<h2 id="sloop">1.2 <a href="#sloop">Sloop</a></h2>
<p>The <code>sloop</code> library is an integration of Python's <code>asyncio</code> library with the
Simics scheduler. The library provides means to create and run tasks based on
coroutine functions (declared in Python using the <code>async def</code> syntax), but
where the progression of an <code>asyncio</code> coroutine typically depends on
asynchronous operating system events on the host machine, the progression of a
<code>sloop</code> coroutine instead depends on simulation events. The API of the <code>sloop</code>
library generally imitates <code>asyncio</code>, but only supports a subset of all
functions available in <code>asyncio</code>. Most notably, <code>sloop.create_task</code> spawns a
task which can await simulation events, and <code>sloop.run_until_complete</code> runs
simulation until a sloop-based awaitable yields, similar to the <code>run-until</code>
commands in Simics CLI.</p>
<p>The <code>sloop</code> library also contains some primitives specific to Simics, in
particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wait(snp)</code> is a coroutine that returns the next value yielded by a snooper
<code>snp</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>timeout</code> asynchronous context manager is similar to its <code>asyncio</code>
counterpart, but the timeout is specified by a snooper rather than a number
of host seconds. For instance, <code>async with timeout(snoop.Seconds(conf.cpu0, 1)):</code> gives a timeout if the block is not exited within one simulated second.</li>
<li>The <code>Tracer</code> asynchronous context manager and the <code>trace</code> coroutine are used
to collect a sequence of values from a snooper into an asynchronous iterator
and list, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integration-with-script-branches">1.3 <a href="#integration-with-script-branches">Integration with script-branches</a></h2>
<p>Script branches serve a similar purpose as <code>sloop</code> coroutines; just like
coroutines, script branches are Python subroutines that run piecewise in Global
Context to provide an asynchronous behaviour. Thanks to this similarity, the
<code>script_branch</code> module provides a two-way integration between script-branches
and <code>sloop</code> coroutines; this permits gradual migration of script-branches to
<code>sloop</code> coroutines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A snooper <code>script_branch.ScriptBranch(f, *args, **kwargs)</code> starts a script
branch that repeatedly calls <code>f(*args, **kwargs)</code>, where <code>f</code> is a script
branch function, and yields each return value. This is typically useful to
call a <code>sb_wait_*</code> call from a <code>sloop</code> coroutine; e.g., the expression <code>await wait(ScriptBranch(script_branch.sb_wait_log(obj)))</code> is roughly equivalent to
<code>await wait(snoop.Log(obj))</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The function <code>script_branch.sb_wait_for_sloop_awaitable(awaitable, loop=sloop.loop)</code> can be used within a script branch to await a task or
coroutine. Similarly, <code>sb_wait_for_snooper</code> can be used to wait directly
for a snooper inside a script branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="integration-with-the-breakpoint-manager">1.4 <a href="#integration-with-the-breakpoint-manager">Integration with the Breakpoint Manager</a></h2>
<p>The breakpoint manager, represented by the <code>bp</code> configuration object, provides
a number of <em>breakpoint types</em>, which are similar in spirit to snoopers: Like a
snooper, a breakpoint type represents an observable simulation event, and
provides various options for awaiting or tracing this event. The <code>bp-manager</code>
module provides a generic wrapper that turns a breakpoint type into a snooper:
The Python class <code>simmod.bp_manager.bp_type.BP(obj, *args, **kwargs)</code> is a
snooper based on the breakpoint type represented by the configuration object
<code>obj</code>, where <code>args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> are interpreted as CLI arguments to the
breakpoint type. For instance, the command <code>bp.log.run-until substr = "a.*b" -regexp</code>, which has a direct Python wrapping
<code>conf.bp.log.cli_cmds.run_until(substr='a.*b', regexp=True)</code>, can be wrapped in
a snooper as <code>simmod.bp_manager.bp_type.BP(conf.bp.log, substr='a.*b', regexp=True)</code>.</p>
