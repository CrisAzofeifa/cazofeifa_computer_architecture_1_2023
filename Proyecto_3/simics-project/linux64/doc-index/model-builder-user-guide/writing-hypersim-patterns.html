<a name="hypersim"></a>
<a name="hypersim-pattern-matcher"></a>
</p><p>
For an introduction on what <em>hypersimulation</em> is, see
<em>Simics User Guide</em>, in Performance chapter.
</p><p>
Simics has a module called <b>hypersim-pattern-matcher</b>,
that manages a number of specific idle-loop machine code
patterns, <em>hypersim-patterns</em>. The theory of operation is that
each pattern registers itself into a global database, from where the
matcher selects the patterns that matches the simulated
architecture. The matcher then insert hooks into those processors to
detect when the binary code matches any of the patterns. If a match is
found, an execute breakpoint is set at this address to allow the
pattern to fast-forward the simulation every time the CPU reaches the
pattern.
</p><p>
The <em>Automatic Hypersimulation</em> feature in Simics 6
reduces the need to write manual patterns. The ability to detect loops
which can be hypersimulated is part of the JIT compiler for PPC, ARM
and MIPS processor models. Loops that can be detected must fit into
one compilation unit and may not contain any store instruction in the
loop path. Automatically detected loops have lower insertion overhead
and simulates faster compared to using the
hypersim-pattern-matcher. Consequently, old manual written patterns,
describing simple loops, might now be detected automatically with
increased performance. These manual patterns should therefore
be removed.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Overview">47.1 Overview</a></h2>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="finding-loop">47.1.1 Locating Idle Loops</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
With <em>idle loops</em> we mean any kind of loop that does not
calculate any value; this include spin-locks, busy-wait loops,
variable polling, and timing loops. 
</p><p>
The easiest way to locate the idle loop is simply to pause the
simulation when it appears to do nothing but still takes time to
simulate. Chances are high that the CPU is stopped somewhere in the
idle loop. You can then use the <b>step-instruction</b> command to
single step and inspect the instructions being executed. If you see a
repetitive pattern here, there is a small loop that could possibly be
optimized. The <code>-r</code> flag to <b>step-instruction</b> will
print register updates, it is helpful to understand if there is a
counter involved in the loop.
</p><p>
The next step is to verify that it only accesses RAM on predictable
addresses. Loops that polls a device is not possible to hypersimulate,
unless the device accesses are free from side-effects. To inspect
this, you can insert a tracer using <b>new-tracer</b>
and <b>trace-io</b>.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="create-pattern">47.1.2 Creating Pattern Classes</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Each pattern should register itself as a Simics Class with certain
interfaces and attributes. Please see section
<a class="reference" href="#object-structure">47.2.4</a> for detailed information.
</p><p>
The pattern matcher accept patterns in two different formats. The
generic format is as a hexadecimal or binary string. However, since
architectures with constant-width instructions of 4 bytes are common,
there is a simpler format as a list of (value, mask) pairs. This form
specifies the instruction opcodes and masks to match in 32-bit big
endian format.
</p><p>
The simplest option is to convert the loop into a pattern that should
match exactly, but more general patterns are also possible, for
example by using any register, and the instructions that are not part
of the loop could be left out. However, we recommend keeping the
pattern exact until you actually face another loop which could have
matched too. See section <a class="reference" href="#small-variations">47.2.1</a> how to match
with wildcards.
</p><p>
If the two parts of the loop are separated, one could use a
main pattern and a <em>sub-pattern</em>. See section
<a class="reference" href="#subpatterns">47.2.2</a> for more information on how to match
sub-patterns.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="determine-conditions">47.1.3 Determine Conditions</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Next step is to determine what should happen every time the identified
loop is entered. First, the necessary <em>pre-conditions</em> should
be checked.
</p><p>
When all pre-conditions are fulfilled, the simulation can be
fast-forwarded. To make it easier to update the state after
fast-forwarding, we only fast-forward an even number of iteration, and
let the processor simulate the last iteration. Then the pattern don't
need to do any state updates by itself.
</p><p>
If the pattern gave no limit on how far a processor can be fast-forwarded,
the pattern matcher will fast-forward it to the next event posted. The
<b><i>advance()</i></b> function in the <code>step</code> interface is
used to let the CPU actually fast-forward.
</p><p>
If the pattern need to do side-effects, it gets the actual number of
steps forwarded as a return value from the <b><i>ffwd_time()</i></b>
function. Here is an example that needs to update a loop register:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">static bool
pattern_triggered(conf_object_t *obj, pattern_t *handle, void *loop_data,
                  conf_object_t *cpu, physical_address_t paddr)
{
        test_pattern_t *tp = (test_pattern_t *)obj;
        struct per_loop_data *loop = loop_data;

        if (SIM_object_class(cpu) != loop-&gt;cached_class) {
                /* Either there is no cached interface pointer or it was cached
                   for another cpu class, so read them out again. */
                if (cache_interfaces(obj, loop, cpu) == 0)
                        return false;
        }

        int steps = tp-&gt;matcher.iface-&gt;ffwd_time(
                tp-&gt;matcher.obj,
                handle,
                cpu,
                LOOP_INSTR,
                0,
                0,
                COUNT_AS_IDLE);

        int regno = loop-&gt;cpuclass_regno;
        loop-&gt;reg_iface-&gt;write(cpu, regno,
                               loop-&gt;reg_iface-&gt;read(cpu, regno)
                               + steps / LOOP_INSTR);
        return true;
}
</pre><p>

</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="test-correctness">47.1.4 Test Correctness</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The quickest way to test that patterns are deterministic is to try
running your machine with and without hypersim-patterns installed, and
see if the state differs.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="measure-improvements">47.1.5 Measure Performance Improvements</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The impact of hypersimulating idle-patterns can be measured by
the <b>system-perfmeter</b> tool. The <b>hypersim-status</b>
command also have some information about how many steps that have been
skipped.
</p><p>
If the performance did not improve as much as expected, it might be
that either the pattern matched too often but the examine_pattern()
method rejected it, or that the preconditions was not fulfilled often
enough in the pattern_triggered() call. The percentage of successful
calls can be listed with the <b>hypersim-status -v</b> command.
</p><p>


</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Advanced-Topics">47.2 Advanced Topics</a></h2>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="small-variations">47.2.1 Handling Small Variations in Patterns</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Often, a recompilation of the software can lead to small differences
in the bit pattern of the idle loop. A pattern can be made to match
many variants by placing <em>wildcards</em> in a pattern. Wildcards
are done by replacing a digit in the pattern by a + sign, or, in the
specialized pattern style, with zeros in the mask. One of our test
patterns has wildcards on register values.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">static const char * const pattern[] = {
        "0x60000000",                    /* A. nop */
        "0b0011_10++_++++_++++ 0x0001",  /* B. addi rX,rY,1 */
        "0x4bfffff8",                    /* C. b A */
        NULL
};
</pre><p>

</p><p>
If there are constraints on the wildcards, they need to be checked in
the examine function. To continue the previous example, here is how it
verifies that the same register is used as source and destination in
the <code>addi</code> instruction.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">static void *
examine_pattern(conf_object_t *obj, pattern_t *handle, conf_object_t *cpu,
                logical_address_t vaddr, physical_address_t paddr)
{
        uint32 addi_insn = SIM_read_phys_memory(cpu, paddr + 4, 4);
        if (SIM_clear_exception() != SimExc_No_Exception)
                return NULL;

        int reg = (addi_insn &gt;&gt; 16) &amp; 31;
        if (((addi_insn &gt;&gt; 21) &amp; 31) != reg) {
                /* addi rX,rY,1 where X != Y means no match */
                return NULL;
        }

        struct per_loop_data *loop = MM_ZALLOC(1, struct per_loop_data);
        loop-&gt;incremented_register = reg;
        return loop;
}
</pre><p>

</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="subpatterns">47.2.2 Subpatterns</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
If the idle loop contains subroutine calls, the subroutine needs to be
checked against a pattern too. This is done in the <em>examine</em>
function. An example from
the <b>mpc-u-boot-hypersim-patterns</b> module is given
below.
</p><p>

</p><p>
A loop which polls a cycle counter is called a time-dependent loop. An
example that reads the timebase register on a PPC processor, whose
pattern is given in section <a class="reference" href="#subpatterns">47.2.2</a>. Since steps and
cycles does not correspond 1-to-1 in Simics, we need to take into
account the conversion factor. In the case of timebase, the conversion
is given by the equation:
</p><p>
steps = timebase cycles × cpu frequency × step-rate / timebase frequency
</p><p>
Below is an example from
<code></code><em>[simics]</em><code>/src/extensions/mpc-u-boot-hypersim-patterns/wait-ticks.c</code>.
In this example, the step-rate is not taken into account, so it only works for an
1:1 step-rate.

<p>

</p><p>
When Simics is started, the individual pattern modules announces their
existence by calling the Python
function <b><i>hypersim_patterns.add()</i></b>, from
their <code>simics_start.py</code> files.
</p><p>
When a machine configuration is later loaded, its CPU architectures
are checked against the registered patterns.
</p><p>
If there are patterns matching an architecture, an object of
type <b>hypersim-pattern-matcher</b> is created and attached
to the physical memory-space of that processor. This matcher object
will, in turn, create one object for each registered pattern.
</p><p>
The reason why a pattern both need to register in Python code and
later in C code is to avoid loading modules for hypersim patterns
unrelated to the architecture being simulated.
</p><p>
The <b>hypersim-pattern-matcher</b> creates patterns with the
SIM_create_object() call and sets the "matcher" attribute to point
back to itself. That means there will be one pattern instance for each
physical memory-space in the system.
