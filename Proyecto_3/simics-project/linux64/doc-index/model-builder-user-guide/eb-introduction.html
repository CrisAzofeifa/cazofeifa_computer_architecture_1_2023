<p>

The Simulator API in Simics Model Builder provides a rich API that enables
users to extend the functionality of Simics. This API was introduced in
Simics 4.4 to more clearly separate between hardware modeling activities and
the development of simulator add-on features, simplifying both kinds of
activities.
</p><p>
Typical Simics extensions include tracers, connections to external
applications and hardware, statistics collectors, integrations with
other simulators, memory timing models and foreign processor
models. This document describes some such extensions and how they may
be developed, but many other kind of extensions can be built using
the <em>Simulator API</em> included in the product. It is only the
development of extension modules that require Simics Model Builder product,
any Simics user may run the resulting module.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Processor-API">39.1 Processor API</a></h2>
<p>
 The <a name="Processor-API2">Processor API</a> is used to add
processor models to Simics. The most common use case is importing and
adapting foreign processor simulators. The API is described in the separate
<em>Processor Model Integration Guide</em>.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Simulator-API">39.2 Simulator API</a></h2>
<p>

The <a name="Simulator-API2">Simulator API</a> contains the complete Simics API, including parts
that are not available to models.

Extension modules are built in the same way as device model modules and are
typically written in C/C++ or Python. The device modeling tool DML simplifies
device modeling a lot but does not provide many benefits when writing simulator
extensions. The <a name="build-environment">build environment</a> for Simics modules is documented
in chapter <a class="reference" href="build-environment.html">3</a>.
