Simics supports writing I2C devices. There are two ways to model an
I2C device. The easiest way is to let the I2C device implement the
<code>i2c_device</code> interface. The interface models the
communication on high level, moving one byte in each transfer. The
other way to model an I2C device is to implement the actual bit lines
defined in the I2C standard. Modeling an I2C device model on high
level is described in <a class="reference" href="#i2c-high-level">19.2</a> and on low level
is described in <a class="reference" href="#i2c-low-level">19.3</a>.
</p><p>
I2C devices in Simics are connected to an I2C bus (the
<b>i2c_bus</b> class). The bus relays transfers from I2C
device masters to I2C device slaves. The master is the I2C device
initiating the transfer. The slave is the I2C device responding to the
transfer. An I2C device can act as both master and slave but not at
the same time.
</p><p>
Each slave has a 7-bit address. The master uses the address to
communicate with the slave. A slave can have more than one address.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="i2c-high-level">19.2 High-Level I2C Device Modeling</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
I2C devices can implement the <code>i2c_device</code>
interface. This interface is a high level interface which transfers
bytes instead of bits. The requirement for using this interface is
that the I2C device does not make the actual physical line status
visible for software or other hardware. The I2C bus implements
<code>i2c_bus</code> interface which is used in combination with the
<code>i2c_device</code> interface to form a high-level connection.
</p><p>
Simics includes a sample I2C device with source code. The name of the
module is <i>sample-i2c-device</i>. You can copy the code to your
project, try it out, or modify it to fit your requirements.
</p><p>
See the documentation for the <code>i2c_bus</code> interface and
<code>i2c_device</code> interface to get a more detailed description
how to use the interfaces and implement I2C devices.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="i2c-low-level">19.3 Low-Level I2C Device Modeling</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The I2C bus also support low-level I2C device implementations using
signals defined in the I2C standard. Only bus masters can use the
low-level interface.
</p><p>
I2C have two wires, clock and data, where the data line
is bidirectional. In Simics, the bidirectional line is
modeled as two unidirectional signals, one going from the master
to the bus, and one going from the bus to the master.
The <b>i2c-bus</b> implements two <code>signal</code> ports,
<code>SCL</code> and <code>SDA</code>, and provides one signal attribute
<code>sda_target</code> for the SDA signal going from the bus to the
master. The example setup in figure <a class="reference" href="#i2c_lowlevel_img">7</a>
illustrates this.
