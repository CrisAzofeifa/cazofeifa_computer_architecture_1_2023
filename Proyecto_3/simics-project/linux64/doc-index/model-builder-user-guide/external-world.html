<p>

This section discusses how Simics extensions can support communication
with real hardware or external tools such as debuggers, test generators,
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and other simulators.
</p><p>
For example, Simics itself supports communication with the external
world in a number of ways:
</p><ul>
<li>User interaction via keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>Integration with debuggers and IDEs such as:
  <ul>
    <li>GNU's GDB</li>
    <li>Wind River's WorkBench</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>Connection to the real Ethernet network</li>
<li>Access to raw hard disk</li>
<li>Connecting to a real 1553 bus</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following sub-chapters discusses how to make these types of
extensions deterministic, portable and use the appropriate APIs for
various circumstances.  Chapter <a class="reference" href="other-applications.html">46</a> also
discusses how to link external libraries with Simics extensions, or
how to link Simics into another application.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Recording-External-Input">44.1 Recording External Input</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="external-input"></a><a name="playback"></a>
Being able to connect the simulated world with the real one is useful in many
situations, for example to get keyboard input into a simulated console or to
be able to access real file servers from a simulated system. At the same time,
one of the most important and powerful characteristics of Simics, the
determinism, is at risk. A deterministic simulation can be rerun over and over
again with the same result. This greatly simplifies debugging of hard-to-catch
bugs, since once an incorrect behavior is triggered in Simics, it can always
be reproduced by rerunning the simulation.
</p><p>
To keep the determinism even when there are real world connections, Simics
has support for recording all incoming asynchronous input. The recording is
done in the bridges between the simulation and the real world. The devices in
the simulated system are not aware of the recording, and model developers do
not have to implement recording support. It is only when creating connections
to the real world that recording has to be considered.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Recording-and-Simulator-Interaction">44.1.1 Recording and Simulator Interaction</a></h3>
<p>

Simics currently only records data received for the simulated system. It does
not record user interaction with the simulator itself, for example from a
debugger connection. This means that when a session is replayed, for example
by using reverse execution, such interaction has to be reproduced as well. But
this also enables the user to try alternative futures by manually changing
some value and rerun the same session. It is possible that Simics in the future
will provide ways to record and replay interactions with the simulator itself
as well.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Interfacing-the-Recorder">44.1.2 Interfacing the Recorder</a></h3>
<p>

The <b><a name="recorder">recorder</a></b> class provides the needed functionality
for recording and replaying input. A typically configured system in Simics has
one recorder object for each cell, since the recorder itself only can be
accessed from the thread that it belongs to.
The recorder is used to support reverse execution and session checkpoints, and
any extension that interfaces to the outside world should record asynchronous
inputs using the recorder.
</p><p>
To implement recording support in a class (the extension) that bridges the
real and the simulated worlds, the extension should first have an attribute
called
<i>recorder</i> that takes an object. The object assigned through
this interface will implement the <code>recorder_v2</code> interface
and is typically the standard Simics recorder object.
The extension also has to implement the <code>recorded</code> interface, and
its <b><i>input</i></b> method.
</p><p>
When a machine configuration is created in Simics, the configuration system
will automatically create one recorder for each cell, and assign this recorder
to all objects with a <i>recorder</i> attribute.
If an extension is created as part of a component-based system setup, the
recorder will thus be automatically set. If an extension is created outside of
the component system, it is necessary to manually assign the recorder
attribute.
</p><p>
When the extension class receives asynchronous input, it should always send it
through the recorder, no matter if recording is enabled or not. It is actually
only the recorder itself that knows if recording or playback is active. The
extension does not have to care, and the code flow is identical in all runs.
The extension implementation should simply send all received input to the
recorder using the <b><i>record</i></b> method.
</p><p>
The <b><i>record</i></b> method gets the extension object itself as an argument,
and will immediately call the extension using the <b><i>input</i></b> method in
the <code>recorded</code> interface of the extension. The simulation work
related to handling the input has to be done in the <b><i>input</i></b>
method. When input is replayed, the extension will only get a sequence of
calls to <b><i>input</i></b>, based on the recorded data.
</p><p>
For the few cases when a real network connection has to know if the input it
receives is a recording or live data, it can query the recorder using the
<b><i>playback</i></b> method in the <code>recorder_v2</code> interface.

</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="sockets">44.2 Socket Programming in Simics</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="sockets2"></a><a name="SIM_notify_on_socket"></a>
When integrating Simics with another tool it is not uncommon that some kind of
communication between the two is needed in run time. A common way to
communicate between processes is to use <em>sockets</em>. On Linux hosts the
Berkeley (BSD) socket API is used and on Windows the similar <em>Winsock</em>
interface exists. While creating sockets using the <code>socket()</code> call and
reading/writing data on the socket is similar on all systems, it is often
difficult to wait for events on several sockets in different independent parts
of a program simultaneously without using threads. Simics simplifies this in an
operating system independent way by offering a single interface for waiting on
sockets events:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">void
SIM_notify_on_socket(socket_t sock, notify_mode_t mode, int run_in_thread,
                     void (*callback)(lang_void *data), lang_void *data);
</pre><p>
The <b><i>SIM_notify_on_socket()</i></b> function tells Simics to wait for some
activity on a specified socket <i>sock</i>, previously created using
the system API function <code>socket()</code>. Once the socket requires attention,
for example that there is data available to read, the user function identified
by <i>callback</i> is called by Simics with <i>data</i> as
argument.
</p><p>
To be able to wait for events on sockets while at the same time have the
simulation executing, Simics keeps a separate polling thread that is only used
to wait for external events. It is possible to tell Simics to always run
the user-installed callback in this polling thread as soon as the socket event
occurs by supplying a non-zero <i>run_in_thread</i>, but in most cases
it is better to run the user callback in a simulation thread once it is safe
to do so. A callback run in the polling thread may not access the Simics API
for example, with the exception of <b><i>SIM_thread_safe_callback()</i></b>.
</p><p>
There are more details on <b><i>SIM_notify_on_socket()</i></b> in the
<em>API Reference Manual</em>.
</p><p>
In addition to socket notifications, Simics also provides two host dependent
functions that simplify the task of waiting on external input. On Windows hosts
it is possible to wait for <em>waitable objects</em> and on Linux systems on
file descriptors. See the reference documentation for
<b><i>SIM_notify_on_object()</i></b> and <b><i>SIM_notify_on_descriptor()</i></b>.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Writing-Portable-Code">44.3 Writing Portable Code</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics device models are typically portable since they only use the
Simics device API. However, extensions which communicates with the
external world may need to use the operating system more directly.
The means extensions need to consider portability across operating
systems and host architectures, if this is desired.
</p><p>
Some general guidelines:

hosts and that they are compatible.</dd><dt id="dt:file-paths"><b>File paths</b></dt><dd>See <b><i>SIM_native_path()</i></b> and <b><i>SIM_lookup_file()</i></b> for some

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Writing-Debugger-Connections">44.4 Writing Debugger Connections</a></h2>
<p>

Simics can be controlled and inspected from multiple sources, such as the
Simics command line, or the GNU
Debugger (<a name="GDB">GDB</a>).
</p><p>
Additional ways to control Simics can be added, and this section explains what
needs to be considered to make this work correctly. A good example can be found
in the source code for the <b><a name="gdb-remote">gdb-remote</a></b> module, which
is included in the Simics Base package. It implements the debugger
connection for the GNU Debugger.
</p><p>
It is recommended that a new (debugger) connection is implemented in a new
module.
</p><p>
The following chapters describe some of the things you need to take into
account if you want to implement support for a new way to control Simics, with
focus on supporting a new debugger.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Connect-and-Disconnect">44.4.1 Connect and Disconnect</a></h3>
<p>

It is recommended that the new module defines a new global command in
its <code>simics_start.py</code> that starts listening to incoming connection
requests, connects to an already running external program, or launches an
external debugger and then connects to it.
</p><p>
In <code>gdb-remote/simics_start.py</code>, the
command <b>new-gdb-remote</b> is defined, which starts listening
to new connections from an external GDB session.
</p><p>
If your debugger connection is done using sockets (e.g., if it uses TCP/IP),
you should read chapter <a class="reference" href="#sockets">44.2</a>.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Starting-and-Stopping-the-Simulation">44.4.2 Starting and Stopping the Simulation</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
When the user wants to start the simulation, you need to
call <b><i><a name="SIM_continue">SIM_continue</a></i></b>. This needs to be done from
<em>Global Context</em>, which means that you cannot do it in a callback
from <b><i><a name="SIM_notify_on_socket2">SIM_notify_on_socket</a></i></b>, a hap callback, or similar.
Instead, you need to call <b><i><a name="SIM_register_work">SIM_register_work</a></i></b>, and from its
callback function, you can call <b><i>SIM_continue</i></b>.
</p><p>
Note that <b><i>SIM_continue</i></b> will not return until the simulation stops
for any reason. This is not a problem if you call it
from <b><i>SIM_register_work</i></b> and use
the <code><a name="Core_Simulation_Stopped">Core_Simulation_Stopped</a></code> hap to detect when the
simulation stops (see below for more information).
</p><p>
Regardless of which API function you are calling, you need to pay careful
attention to which execution context they are allowed to be called from.
</p><p>
You typically want to stop simulating as a result of hitting a breakpoint,
after a certain amount of time or number of instructions (steps), the user of
the external debugging interactively asking to break the simulation, or
similar.
</p><p>
To break simulation when executing, reading, or writing some particular
address, you should use <b><i><a name="SIM_breakpoint">SIM_breakpoint</a></i></b>. Note that you
usually want to use the <code><a name="Sim_Breakpoint_Simulation">Sim_Breakpoint_Simulation</a></code>
flag for breakpoints set this way. After installing a callback function using
<b><i><a name="SIM_hap_add_callback_index">SIM_hap_add_callback_index</a></i></b>, that callback should
call <b><i><a name="SIM_break_simulation">SIM_break_simulation</a></i></b> to actually stop the
simulation.
</p><p>
Time breakpoints are best implemented using <em><a name="events">events</a></em>. Post an
event at the appropriate point in time
using <b><i><a name="SIM_event_post_time">SIM_event_post_time</a></i></b>,
<b><i><a name="SIM_event_post_cycle">SIM_event_post_cycle</a></i></b>,
or <b><i><a name="SIM_event_post_step">SIM_event_post_step</a></i></b> and
call <b><i>SIM_break_simulation</i></b> from the event handler.
For more information, see the two Events sections of the chapters
<em>Modeling with C</em> and <em>Modeling with Python</em>,
<a class="reference" href="writing-module-with-c.html#c-event">14.7</a> and <a class="reference" href="writing-module-with-pyobj.html#pyobj-event">15.10</a> respectively.
</p><p>
If you need to get a callback once the simulation really has stopped, install a
handler on the <code>Core_Simulation_Stopped</code> hap. Note that Simics may
stop simulating for a host of reasons that may not be related to your module.
For example, the user may have asked Simics to stop from another user
interface, or Simics may have hit an error that prevents it from continuing.
</p><p>
See the documentation for these functions in the <em>API Reference
Manual</em> for further details.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Contexts-and-Process-Tracking">44.4.3 Contexts and Process Tracking</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
To support debugging or inspection of a particular process or task on the
simulated machine, your debugger support module will have to make use of
<em>OS awareness</em>, which is the collection of techniques used to keep track
of information about the simulated operating system.
</p><p>
<em>Process tracking</em>, one of the OS awareness techniques, is what Simics
uses to track which processes are currently alive in the simulated machine, and
to switch the current active context as CPUs start and stop running code
belonging to different processes. See the <em>Analyzer User's Guide</em>
for more information about process trackers and OS awareness.
</p><p>
To make your debugger module make use of information from the process trackers,
you will need to set breakpoints on the correct context objects and enable or
disable your debugger as the system starts or stops running the processes you
care about.
</p><p>
For example, to support single-stepping one instruction in a particular
process, you need to listen to the different haps triggered by the process
trackers. These are called <code>Core_Context_*</code> and are described
in the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em>.
</p><p>


</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Synchronizing-Virtual-Time">44.5 Synchronizing Virtual Time</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Connections to systems outside the simulation might have real-time
requirements.  For example, an external test generator might time-out
if the required response has not been received with a certain time
period.
</p><p>
Depending on the target system being modelled within Simics, the
modelled target might execute much slower or much faster than
real-time (wall-clock). For more information regarding Simics
simulation performance consult the "Performance" section in
the <em>Simics User's Guide</em>.
</p><p>
This section discusses some techniques on how to adapt the external
world application to work with Simics concept of virtual time instead
of wall-clock time. An alternative, when not only time has to be synchronized
but also messages exchanged, is to use the <em>Time Synchronization
Library</em> described in its own chapter.
</p><p>
The easiest way to handle virtual time is to run all the applications
inside the simulation and not have any external systems. For example,
a test generator can run on its own simulated machine within the
simulation and connect to the system under test through a virtual
network connection. To get the results of the tests out of the
simulation you can use a more tolerant real world connection at the
end of the test. For example, by using a real network connection or
writing the results to a console. This way you avoid the issues
involved in adapting the application to work with virtual time.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="The-Time-Server-and-the-Time-Client">44.5.1 The Time Server and the Time Client</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="time-server"></a>
</p><p>
When interfacing Simics, timing may in some cases pose a problem. For example,
test programs may specify a timeout, but since Simics can run both faster and
slower than real time, the test may either timeout when it should not, or not
timeout when it actually should.
</p><p>
The time server solves this by exporting the virtual time ("Simics time") to
the outer world. Clients can communicate with the time server through TCP/IP,
using the time client library that provides a C-interface to the time server.
</p><p>
</p><h4 class="jdocu"><a name="Time-Client-Library">44.5.1.1 Time Client Library</a></h4>
<p>

<a name="time-client"></a>
</p><p>
The client library provides non-threaded C primitives for all features of the
time server protocol. Using the time client library, interfacing to the time
server is as easy as a C function call.
</p><p>
The following primitives exists:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">    typedef enum {
            Simtime_No_Error,
            Simtime_Socket_Error,         // errno contains last error
            Simtime_Timeout,              // global timeout (as specified in
                                          // simtime_connect)
            Simtime_Receive_Buffer_Full,  // the received message did not fit
                                          // in the buffer. It's probably a bug
                                          // in the time client library if it
                                          // happens
            Simtime_Parse_Error           // received message could not be
                                          // parsed
    } simtime_error_t;


    simtime_error_t simtime_query_time(simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                       double *time);

    simtime_error_t simtime_sleep(simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                  double seconds,
                                  double *time);

    simtime_error_t simtime_periodic_ping(simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                          double interval,
                                          double how_long,
                                          simtime_callback_t cb,
                                          void *user_data);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
<b><i>simtime_query_time</i></b> will return the current virtual time. It is not
expected to block very long (the time server will respond immediately when it
receives the query).
</p><p>
Although tempting, <b><i>simtime_query_time</i></b> should not be used in a tight
polling loop, as it will degrade Simics performance quite noticeably.
</p><p>
Depending on what the timing code looks like, one of the other primitives
should be used instead.
</p><p>
The <b><i>simtime_sleep</i></b> function will block for a specified number of
virtual seconds. Note that this function will never return if Simics is not
simulating, unless a global timeout is specified (see the
<b><i>simtime_connect</i></b> function). This is obviously because the virtual
time is not progressing when the simulation is not running.
</p><p>
If the timeout is not known beforehand, it may not be possible to use
<b><i>simtime_sleep</i></b>. In this case, <b><i>simtime_periodic_ping</i></b> might
be the solution. It will cause Simics to send periodic pings to the client.
The interval between each ping is in real seconds, i.e. host time, not Simics
time. It is also possible to specify a duration, also in real seconds, after
which Simics will stop sending ping messages. If <i>duration</i> is
negative or zero, Simics will continue to send ping messages until told to
stop (non-zero return value from ping message callback function).
</p><p>
For every ping message, the callback function <b><i>cb</i></b> will be called:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">    typedef int (*simtime_callback_t)(void *data,
                                      simtime_context_t *ctx,
                                      int seq_no, double time);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
<i>seq_no</i> contains the sequence number of the received ping
message and <i>time</i> contains the current virtual time.
</p><p>
If the callback function returns a value other than zero, the periodic pings
will be aborted, even though <i>duration</i> real seconds has not yet
passed.
</p><p>
Note that <b><i>simtime_periodic_ping</i></b> will not return until
<i>duration</i> real seconds has passed, or until the callback function
returns a non-zero value. Also note that no simtime API calls should be made
from the callback.
</p><p>
Before any of the above primitives can be used, a connection to the time server
has to be established:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simtime_context_t *simtime_connect(const char *host,
                                       int port,
                                       int global_timeout);
    void simtime_disconnect(simtime_context_t *ctx);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The time client will connect to a time server on <i>host</i> at port
<i>port</i>. If <i>global_timeout</i> is larger than zero,
all calls to simtime will timeout after <i>global_timeout</i> real
seconds. This is useful to detect, for example, a crashed Simics session. But
note that a call to e.g., <b><i>simtime_sleep</i></b> may take very long real time,
depending on how fast Simics is simulating (and, of course, how long the
sleep time is).
</p><p>
To disconnect from the time server, call the function
<b><i>simtime_disconnect</i></b>.
</p><p>
If the client is threaded, care must be taken to not make more than one API
call at a time. The time client library is not designed to handle simultaneous
calls.
</p><p>
