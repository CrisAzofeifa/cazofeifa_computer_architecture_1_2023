<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="Advanced-Programming-with-DML">9 Advanced Programming with DML</a></h1>
<p>

</p><p>
The purpose of this chapter is to describe some advanced DML topics
which may be needed when writing larger and more complex device
models. It assumes that you already know the basics of DML programming.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-the-Simics-API">9.1 Using the Simics API</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The Simics API is a set of C functions and data types. These can be
used by DML code directly by calling the functions as in C.
No <code>call</code> or <code>inline</code> is used to call API functions.
</p><p>
The <em><a name="device-API">device API</a></em> is automatically available in DML,
other parts of the Simics is available by importing API definition
files. See section <em>The Simics API</em> in
<em>API Reference Manual</em> for more information.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Embedding-C-Code">9.2 Embedding C Code</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Since data types and method bodies in DML are written in an extended
subset of C, you can easily call C functions from DML by using normal
function call syntax. So <code>f(x)</code> is a call to the
function <code>f</code> with the argument <code>x</code>, and <code>call</code>
or <code>inline</code> is not used.
</p><p>
To be able to use types and symbols from C code that is linked with
the DML-generated code, the DML code needs to know about them. This is
done by using <em><a name="extern">extern</a></em> declarations. Just like in C,
a function (or variable) can be declared as extern, meaning that it is
defined in a different compilation unit.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">extern int fib(int x);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When importing a C typedef into DML, an <em><a name="externtypedef">extern
typedef</a></em> is used.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">extern typedef struct {
    int x;
} mystruct;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
This tells the DML compiler that the generated C code can use a struct
typedef that has a field called <code>x</code> which is an <code>int</code>.
Note that the DML does not know anything about the actual in-memory
data layout of this struct, and there may even be other fields in the
struct in the real type (as defined in C). This means that it is
possible to define opaque struct typedefs like this:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">extern typedef struct { } opaque_data;
extern void f(opaque_data *data);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
<a name="enum"></a> Enumerated types in C and the constants defined by
them can be imported in DML in a similar fashion with
the <em><a name="extern2">extern</a></em> keyword. For example, suppose a C
header file includes the following definition:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef enum process_type {
     SMALL = 1,
     MEDIUM,
     BIG
} process_type_t;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To import this definition into DML, each of the names has to be
introduced by a separate <em><a name="extern3">extern</a></em> declaration at the
top level. One way of achieving this is: 
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">extern typedef int process_type_t;
extern const process_type_t SMALL;
extern const process_type_t MEDIUM;
extern const process_type_t BIG;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To be able to use the external types and symbols, it is not enough to
import their definitions into DML. It is also necessary to add C code
that includes these definitions to the files that the DML compiler
generates. This is done by using <code><a name="header">header</a></code> and
<code><a name="footer">footer</a></code> in the DML code. Both take blocks of C code
that is included verbatim in the generated output. The difference is
that the header code goes at the top of the output and the footer goes
to the bottom. The most typical use is to have an <code>#include</code>
statement of a C header file inside a <code>header</code> block and the
implementation in a separate C file. If a local support function needs
to be implemented in C, the best way is usually to add a prototype in
the header and the function implementation in the footer.
</p><p>
Below is an example of a DML model that uses embedded C code. It is
based on the simple memory mapped device described in section
<a class="reference" href="device-modeling-overview.html">4</a>:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">dml 1.2;
device simple_embedded;
parameter documentation = "Embedding C code example for"
    + " Model Builder User's Guide";
parameter desc = "example of C code";

extern int fib(int x);

bank regs {
    register r0 size 4 @0x0000 {
        parameter allocate = false;
        parameter configuration = "none";
        method write(val) {
            log "info": "Fibonacci(%d) = %d.", val, fib(val);
        }

        method read() -&gt; (value) {
            // Must be implemented to compile            
        }
       
    }
}

header %{
int fib(int x);
%}

footer %{
int fib(int x) {
    if (x &lt; 2) return 1;
    else return fib(x-1) + fib(x-2);
}
%}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Writing to the (pseudo-) register <code>r0</code> has the effect of printing
a log message with the computed Fibonacci number:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt;  <b>phys_mem.write 0x1000 6 -l</b>
[dev1 info] Fibonacci(6) = 13.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Notable points are:
</p><ul>
  <li>The C identifier <code>fib</code> is declared in DML using a top-level
      <code>extern</code> declaration.</li>

  <li>The section <code>footer %{ </code><i>…</i><code> %}</code> is appended verbatim to the
      C program generated by the DML compiler (<code>dmlc</code>). Its
      contents are not examined in any way by <code>dmlc</code>.</li>

  <li>Similarly, the <code>header %{ </code><i>…</i><code> %}</code> section is included
      verbatim at the beginning of the program generated by
      <code>dmlc</code>.</li>

  <li>It is normally better to place C functions in separately compiled
      files, if possible, and link with the generated DML code. (To do
      this, you need to modify the Makefile for the module.)</li>

  <li>The function declaration must be included in the header section
      as well as being declared <code>extern</code> in DML. They are
      usually identical, but not always, and thus the C
      declaration is not automatically generated by <code>dmlc</code>; this
      could change in future DML revisions.</li>

  <li>Header and footer sections could become deprecated or removed in
      future versions of DML.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Device part of the Simics API (a set of C functions and data types) is
always available in DML. Other parts of the Simics API can also be included
as described in section <em>The Simics API</em> in
<em>API Reference Manual</em> documentation.
</p><p>
For example, this is how the method <b><i>set_read_value()</i></b> is
implemented in the standard library. It updates a
<code>generic_transaction_t</code> structure (a "memory operation") at the
end of a
read access to a memory bank has finished, depending on the endianness of
the bank:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">method set_read_value(generic_transaction_t *memop, uint64 value) default {
    if (!defined $byte_order)
        error "undefined byte order";
    else if ($byte_order == "little-endian")
        SIM_set_mem_op_value_le(memop, value);
    else if ($byte_order == "big-endian")
        SIM_set_mem_op_value_be(memop, value);
    else
        error "bad value for parameter 'byte_order'";
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The sample code
in <code></code><em>[simics]</em><code>/src/devices/sample-device-mixed</code> has
more examples.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Calling-Back-From-C">9.3 Calling Back From C</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Sometimes it is also necessary to call DML code from external code.
The best way to do this is by defining a Simics interface to the DML
device and then using that from the C code. The sample code
in <code></code><em>[simics]</em><code>/src/devices/sample-device-mixed</code> shows
how it can be done:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef struct {
        void (*one)(conf_object_t *obj);
        void (*two)(conf_object_t *obj, uint32 count);
} myinterface_interface_t;

implement myinterface {
    method one() {
        log "info": "ONE";
    }
    method two(uint32 count) {
        log "info": "TWO %u", count;
    }
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
The above defines a model-specific interface and implements it. The
interface definition is a struct of function pointers, just like all
Simics interfaces. The interface struct type will be part of the
generated C code, which means that it can be used by other C code
generated by DMLC. For code included in a <code>footer</code> block, it
is automatically known.
</p><p>
The C code that wants to call the interface needs to
use <b><i>SIM_c_get_interface</i></b> to get the function pointers to
use.
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">void call_out_to_c(conf_object_t *obj) {
        const myinterface_interface_t *iface =
                SIM_c_get_interface(obj, "myinterface");
        ASSERT(iface);
        iface-&gt;one(obj);
        iface-&gt;two(obj, 4711);
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
It is not necessary to do this every time, the return value
from <b><i>SIM_c_get_interface</i></b> can, and should, be cached.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="dml-and-c++">9.4 Integrating with C++</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The DML compiler generates C code, and this means that it integrates
well with anything that C integrates well with. This includes C++
functions and types declared with <code>extern "C"</code>. It is not
possible to call ordinary C++ functions or methods directly, but it is
simple to create C wrappers in the C++ code and make sure they are
declared with <code>extern "C"</code>.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="dividing-device">9.5 Dividing a Device into Classes</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Large devices often consist of several logical units. The best way to
know if the device should be divided in logical units is to look at
the device specification. Logical units are often mapped to specific
physical memory address regions, or their registers are grouped
together. We call these register groups <i>banks</i>.
</p><p>
An example of a device with many logical units is a system
controller. A system controller can include a memory controller, a
watchdog, an interrupt controller, an Ethernet controller, etc. This
makes it a good candidate to cut in pieces. On the other hand, devices
with few registers should be left in one piece, as several classes
makes it a bit harder to instantiate a working device in the
simulator.
</p><p>
The first major decision when modeling a large device in DML is how to
divide the device in easily manageable parts. There are basically two
ways to model a large device with several logical units in
Simics. This is discussed in section <a class="reference" href="#divide-one-class">9.5.1</a>
and <a class="reference" href="#divide-multiple-classes">9.5.2</a>.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="divide-one-class">9.5.1 One Class Only</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The first way to model a device comprising several logical units is to
include all functionality in a single class.
</p><p>
The major advantage of not splitting up a device is to simplify the
internal communication between the logical units. All logical units
can directly access other units. If they were divided into separate
classes, specific interfaces would need to be created for the units to
communicate.
</p><p>
For example, a system controller often contains an interrupt unit
which forwards all interrupts to the CPU. Each logical unit must be
able to access internal registers or functions in the interrupt unit
to generate its interrupts. A device divided in several logical units
will require an interrupt interface between the interrupt controller and
all other logical units.
</p><p>
Another advantage of not splitting up a device is to simplify the
system setup. All internal communication for a divided device must be
set up in scripts or components. Logical units must have connections
to other logical units to know which unit to communicate with. The
setup for external connections can also increase when dividing a
device. Several classes may need connections to the same objects, such
as memory spaces. A device built in one class needs only one
connection.
</p><p>
To put it simply: fewer classes make for fewer connections, which
simplifies the setup phase.
</p><p>
It is recommended to create one bank for each logical unit. Each bank
should be defined in its own DML file. Here is an example how to
divide a device in several files without splitting the device in
classes.

    }

}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Note that the example code uses explicit log-groups for each logical
unit. It helps when debugging the device.
</p><p>
It is possible to set up the logging to handle log-messages from a
specific log-group only, suppressing log-messages from other groups
that otherwise would have made debugging harder. This is not a problem
for devices divided in several classes. Each class is a separate
log-object with its own log-level and log-group.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="divide-multiple-classes">9.5.2 One Class for Each Logical Unit</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The second way to model a device with several logical units is to
create one class for each logical unit.
</p><p>
The major advantage of this approach is the option to combine several
classes to form new devices. A device family can consist of several
devices that are almost identical, but where several logical units
have been replaced; one device can include a Fast Ethernet controller,
another a Gigabit Ethernet controller. Hardware vendors often have one
IP-block for each logical unit and they combine the blocks to create a
updated device. The same thing can be done with Simics classes. A
device split in classes only requires a script file to create a new
device. Otherwise you have to create a new Simics module for the new
device, but you can reuse the code for an already existing device by
letting the two devices share the code. Section <a class="reference" href="#device-sharing-dml-code">9.6</a> explains how to share DML code.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="device-sharing-dml-code">9.6 Device Sharing DML Code</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
It is possible to share DML code between devices in Simics. Simics also include
generic DML code to create various type of devices. For example, PCI devices in
Simics are easy to write in DML using the standard PCI device code. Several PCI
devices share the same PCI code. The common PCI code defines a couple of
templates that can be combined and configured according to the model needs. PCI
devices in DML is described in the Technology Guide "PCIe Modeling Library"
</p><p>
There are several ways to write your own shared code. Make sure the
shared code use the default statement on functions and parameters to
allow the implementing devices to override them. The most common ways
of writing shared code are listed below, including short code examples
referring to the example code later in this section.
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:redefine-object"><b><i>redefine object</i></b></dt><dd>Two or more devices can share the
same code but define objects differently. Common objects in DML are
<i>banks</i>, <i>registers</i>, <i>fields</i>, <i>connects</i>,
<i>implements</i>, <i>attributes</i>, <i>groups</i>, and
<i>events</i>.
<p>
The bank defines <i>registers</i>, but the registers can differ
between devices sharing the same code. Device specific registers are
defined in the devices and the common registers in the shared code.
</p><p>
The register definition can be different between devices. The register
is declared in the shared code but defined in the device code.
</p></dd><dt id="dt:parameter"><b><i>parameter</i></b></dt><dd>Setting a parameter to default makes it
possible to override it. A default parameter in the shared code can
for instance define a register start offset. The devices importing the
shared code file can override the parameter to change the
offset. Setting a parameter to <code>default undefined</code> forces the
device to define the parameter the compiler will otherwise complain
when building the device. Note that you can only override a parameter
once.</dd><dt id="dt:shared-templates-used-by-device-specific-objects"><b><i>shared templates used by device specific objects</i></b></dt><dd>Defining a template in the shared code makes it possible for the
template to be used across several objects in the specific
devices. The DML library contains a lot of common templates, but you
can also define your own.</dd><dt id="dt:shared-code-using-device-specific-templates"><b><i>shared code using device specific templates</i></b></dt><dd>Using undefined templates in the shared
code makes it possible for each implementation to define its own
variant. Different devices can define the template in different ways
using the same shared code.</dd><dt id="dt:method"><b><i>method</i></b></dt><dd>Shared code can define default methods that
can be overridden by devices. It is then up to the device to override
methods when it is necessary to implement new functionality. Note that
you can only override a function once.</dd></dl><p>
