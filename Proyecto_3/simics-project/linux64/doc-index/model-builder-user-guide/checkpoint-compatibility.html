<p>

</p><p>
As your device models evolve, you may feel the need to change attributes or
devices in ways that might prevent older checkpoints from loading correctly. To
mitigate this problem Simics includes an API that supports handling checkpoint
compatibility while keeping the freedom of changing your models as you deem
necessary.
</p><p>
Checkpoint compatibility is based on the concept of <em>build-id</em>:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>A build-id is a version number that uniquely identify a set of compiled
models.</li>

<li>The build-id of newer models is higher than the build-id of older
models.</li>

<li>Each object saved in a checkpoint is tagged with the build-id of
the model it was an instance of.</li>

</ul>
<p>
As an example, Simics has a single build-id for each distributed build (it
started at 1500 for the Simics 3.2 release). This build-id is used to
update checkpoints when standard Simics models are changed.
</p><p>
When loading an old checkpoint, Simics will look at the build-id that each
object claims. Simics will then run the appropriate update functions until all
objects in the checkpoint are up-to date with the current models. Let us have a
look at some examples.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Simics maintains backward compatibility for checkpoints one major version
older than the oldest of the currently supported API versions. Older
checkpoints might load successfully anyway. If they fail to do so, however, it
is possible to update them in steps by using intermediate versions of Simics
where compatibility was still maintained.</div><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="First-Example-A-Simple-Case">38.1 First Example: A Simple Case</a></h2>
<p>Assume that you have modeled a device with, among other properties, three pins
called <i>pin0</i>, <i>pin1</i> and <i>pin2</i>. The first
version of this model was delivered at build-id 100 (an arbitrarily chosen
number). A checkpoint with this device would look like:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">OBJECT foo TYPE my_device {
        build_id: 100
        pin0: 1
        pin1: 0
        pin2: 1
        <i>[…]</i>
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
A few months later, you extend that model to handle more pins, to the point
where it would make more sense to have a single <i>pins</i> attribute
where bit 0 would represent the state of <i>pin0</i>, and so on. The new
checkpoint at build-id 110 is the following:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">OBJECT foo TYPE my_device {
        build_id: 110
        pins: 0x5            # 0101b
        <i>[…]</i>
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
So far so good, but older checkpoints still contain the three pin<em>n</em>
attributes so they will fail to load with the newer model. To preserve
compatibility, you need to write an upgrade function that will convert the
three pin attributes to the new <i>pins</i> attribute layout. In the
global commands file, <code>simics_start.py</code>, of your device model, write
the following:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">from configuration import *
from update_checkpoint import *

def upgrade_pin_to_pins(obj):
    obj.pins = (obj.pin2 &lt;&lt; 2) | (obj.pin1 &lt;&lt; 1) | obj.pin0
    remove_attr(obj, "pin0")
    remove_attr(obj, "pin1")
    remove_attr(obj, "pin2")

SIM_register_class_update(110, "my_device", upgrade_pin_to_pins)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The first two lines will import the necessary classes and functions from
Simics. The <b><i>upgrade_pin_to_pins()</i></b> function takes an object of class
<b>my_device</b> and computes the new <i>pins</i> attribute from
the values of <i>pin0</i>, <i>pin1</i>, and <i>pin2</i>. It
then removes the obsolete attributes, leaving the object in a valid state for
build-id 110. The last function call registers the
<b><i>upgrade_pin_to_pins()</i></b> function as a <em>class upgrade function</em>,
to be run for all objects of class <b>my_device</b> with a build-id
lower than 110.
</p><p>
When loading a checkpoint with objects of class <b>my_device</b> with a
build-id inferior to 110, Simics will loop over all matching objects to apply
<b><i>upgrade_pin_to_pins()</i></b> and make sure that they are all updated.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Second-Example-Changing-the-Class-of-an-Object">38.2 Second Example: Changing the Class of an Object</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Although this should be a rare occurrence, you might want to change the class
of an object. This can be done in a class upgrade function as above, by setting
the <i>__class_name__</i> attribute:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">from configuration import *
from update_checkpoint import *

def upgrade_to_new_device(obj):
    obj.__class_name__ = "my_new_device"

SIM_register_class_update(120, "my_device", upgrade_to_new_device)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Do not forget that when an object class has changed, no upgrade function
registered on the former class will apply any longer.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Third-Example-Creating-New-Objects">38.3 Third Example: Creating New Objects</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Class upgrade functions are usually enough for simple changes, like adding or
removing an attribute, but you might need to perform more changes to the
checkpoint before it can be loaded.
</p><p>
As an example, let us take a two-port Ethernet controller modeled in a single
class:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">OBJECT foo TYPE two-port-ctrl {
        build-id: 450
        port0_status: 0xCFF
        port0_control: 0x10
        port1_status: 0xC0F
        port1_control: 0x0
        <i>[…]</i>
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Later in the development, you need to improve the Ethernet controller to handle
up to four ports. It might then make more sense to have a class per port, rather
than a class for the whole controller:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">OBJECT foo_port0 TYPE port-ctrl {
        build-id: 480
        status: 0xCFF
        control: 0x10
        <i>[…]</i>
}
OBJECT foo_port1 TYPE port-ctrl {
        build-id: 480
        status: 0xC0F
        control: 0x0
        <i>[…]</i>
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Converting older checkpoint is a bit more difficult though, and class upgrade
functions do not give you enough control to do this properly. You will need a
more <em>generic upgrade function</em>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">from configuration import *
from update_checkpoint import *

def upgrade_two_ports_ctrl(config):
    deleted = []
    changed = []
    added   = []
    
    for obj in all_objects(config, "two-port-ctrl"):
        # build a port 0 object
        obj_port0 = pre_conf_object(obj.name + "_port0", "port-ctrl")
        obj_port0.status = obj.port0_status
        obj_port0.control = obj.port0_control

        # build a port 1 object
        obj_port1 = pre_conf_object(obj.name + "_port1", "port-ctrl")
        obj_port1.status = obj.port1_status
        obj_port1.control = obj.port1_control

        # delete the old object
        del config[obj.name]
        deleted.append(obj)

        # add the two new objects
        config[obj_port0.name] = obj_port0
        config[obj_port1.name] = obj_port1
        added.append(obj_port0)
        added.append(obj_port1)

    return (deleted, changed, added)

SIM_register_generic_update(480, upgrade_two_ports_ctrl)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
A generic upgrade function is called with the complete set of configuration
objects constituting the checkpoint as argument. The variable <i>config</i>
is a Python dictionary indexed by the object names. The function is required to
keep track of all changes it does, in three lists representing the objects
deleted, changed and added to the configuration.
</p><p>
The function loops over all objects of class <b>two-port-ctrl</b> in
<i>config</i>. For each of them, it creates two <b>port-ctrl</b>
objects that will represent the port 0 and 1 of the original controller. It
updates all necessary attributes, then proceeds to delete the old object from
the configuration, before adding the new ones.
</p><p>
When it is finished, the function returns a tuple with the three lists
containing the deleted, changed and added objects. The last line registers the
<b><i>upgrade_two_ports_ctrl()</i></b> function as a generic update function to be
run at build-id 480.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Last-Example-Changing-the-Name-of-an-Object">38.4 Last Example: Changing the Name of an Object</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
If you need to change the name of an object, you will be forced to do so in a
generic update function, as you will have to update the checkpoint set itself:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">from configuration import *
from update_checkpoint import *

def upgrade_to_new_name(config):
    deleted = []
    changed = []
    added   = []
    
    i = 0
    for obj in all_objects(config, "port-ctrl"):
        del config[obj.name]
        obj.name = "new-controller%d" % i
        config[obj.name] = obj
        changed.append(obj)
        i = i + 1

    return (deleted, changed, added)

SIM_register_generic_update(500, upgrade_to_new_name)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Do not forget to report the changed object in the <i>changed</i> object
list.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Choosing-and-Setting-a-Build-Id">Choosing and Setting a Build-Id</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics has a unique build-id for each distributed build. It does not make sense
to follow this setting, as your own development might not match the pace at
which new builds of Simics are released.
</p><p>
You can set a custom build-id in a project using the
<code>USER_BUILD_ID</code> make variable. <code>USER_BUILD_ID</code> is not a simple
number: it is composed of a <em>build-id namespace</em> followed by
a <em>build-id</em>. The build-id namespace is there to define which modules
are following the same convention for build-id versioning. The build-id sets
what the current version is.
</p><p>
For example, assuming you are delivering a complete set of devices to simulate
a board, associated to a Simics processor. You might want to set the build-id
as <code></code><em>company</em><code>.</code><em>board_name</em><code>:0</code>, where <em>company</em> is your
company name, and <em>board-name</em> is the current project. The newly defined
build-id namespace will start its versioning at 0, and increase for each
release.
</p><p>
Simics packages reserve the <code>simics</code> namespace for official
packages. Setting USER_BUILD_ID to use the namespace <code>simics</code> will
result in an error. Similarly, the namespace <code>__simics_project__</code> is
reserved to disable the user build-id mechanism, when <code>USER_BUILD_ID</code> is
left unset.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Checkpoint-Format">Checkpoint Format</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Objects provided in the configuration set are Python
<b>pre_conf_object</b> identical to those handled in components. Each
object has a <i>name</i> and <i>classname</i> attribute. Other
attributes depend on the checkpoint contents.
</p><p>
New objects can be created using the <b>pre_conf_object</b> Python
class. Adding attributes is just a matter of assigning them a value. Other
utility functions, described below, are provided for renaming and removing
attributes.
</p><p>
The class of an object can be changed by setting the
<i>__class_name__</i> attribute to the name of the new class. Both class
and generic functions are allowed to change the class of an object.
</p><p>
The name of an object can be changed by setting the <i>name</i> attribute
of the object. However, the update function should make sure that the
checkpoint set is updated to contain the object under its new name, so only
generic update functions are allowed to perform this change.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Utility-Functions">Utility Functions</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Some common functions are provided by <code>update_checkpoint</code> to make
manipulating a checkpoint easy. They are described in detail in the Reference
Manual:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:all_objects-for_all_objects"><b><b><i>all_objects()</i></b>, <b><i>for_all_objects()</i></b></b></dt><dd>Return all
objects of a given class, or apply a function to all objects of a given
class.</dd><dt id="dt:remove_attr-rename_attr"><b><b><i>remove_attr()</i></b>, <b><i>rename_attr()</i></b></b></dt><dd>Remove or
rename an attribute.</dd><dt id="dt:remove_class_attr"><b><b><i>remove_class_attr()</i></b></b></dt><dd>Remove an attribute in all objects
of a given class.</dd><dt id="dt:remove_class"><b><b><i>remove_class()</i></b></b></dt><dd>Remove all instances of a given
class.</dd></dl><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Class-Upgrade-Functions">Class Upgrade Functions</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
A class upgrade function is the simplest form of upgrade function. It takes as
parameter a <code>pre_conf_object</code> Python object of the class it was
registered for.
</p><p>
The function is allowed to change all attributes, including the object class,
but not its name. It can not destroy or add new objects, since it does not have
access to the complete configuration.
</p><p>
A class upgrade function has no return value. If an error occurs, it can raise
a <code>CliError</code> exception.
</p><p>
Class upgrade functions should generally be declared in the
<code>simics_start.py</code> of the module in which they are declared.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Generic-Upgrade-Functions">Generic Upgrade Functions</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
A generic upgrade function allows for larger changes in the checkpoint. It
takes as parameter the complete set of configuration objects. It is called only
once, at a time where all functions registered for previous build-ids have
already been called.
</p><p>
The function is allowed to perform any operations on the objects of the
checkpoint, including deleting them, changing their attributes and adding new
objects. It can also rename objects, but it is responsible for update the
checkpoint set properly to point at the object under its new name. Renamed
objects should be listed in the changed objects list.
</p><p>
The function must return a tuple of three lists: the list of deleted objects,
the list of changed objects (only changed attributes) and the list of added
objects. If an error occurs, it can raise a <code>CliError</code> exception.
</p><p>
Generic update functions should be declared in a relevant
<code>simics_start.py</code> file. If the function is linked to a specific class
or module, the global commands file of that module is appropriate. In case of
functions dealing with several classes, the function should be declared in the
most relevant component's global commands file.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Manipulating-Standard-Simics-Objects">Manipulating Standard Simics Objects</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
In general, you should refrain from touching objects provided with Simics
in a checkpoint, as they have their own upgrade functions and this might create
conflicts. However, you may need to add such objects to update your
checkpoint, for example, if you wish to add a recorder to one of your models
that was not present before. In that case, you must be careful to indicate the
Simics build-id of the object you are adding, so future upgrade functions
can be applied properly. Let us look at an example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">from configuration import *
from update_checkpoint import *

def get_available_object_name(config, prefix):
    i = 0
    while ("rec%d" % i) in config:
        i = i + 1
    return "rec%d" % i

def add_recorder(config):
    changed = []
    added = []

    port_ctrl_objects = all_objects(config, "port-ctrl")
    if not port_ctrl_objects:
        return ([], [], [])

    recorders = all_objects(config, "recorder")
    if not recorders:
        rec_name = get_available_object_name(config, "rec")
        rec = pre_conf_object(rec_name, "recorder", build_id = 1500)
        config[rec_name] = rec
        added.append(rec)
    else:
        rec = recorders[0]

    for x in port_ctrl_objects:
        if not "recorder" in dir(x):
            setattr(x, "recorder", rec)
            changed.append(x)

    return ([], changed, added)

SIM_register_generic_update(570, add_recorder)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The upgrade function adds a recorder if none exists in the checkpoint, then it makes sure that all objects of class <b>port-ctrl</b> have a
<i>recorder</i> attribute pointing at this recorder. Note the code
creating the recorder object if none is found: it specifies that the recorder
created is of build-id 1500 (corresponding to Simics 3.2.0). This will allow
future upgrade functions to be applied correctly to this new recorder object
later on.
