<p>

</p><p>
Modeling an Ethernet device is a relatively simple task: it must be able to
send and receive Ethernet frames with one of the Ethernet link models that
Simics provides. This is done through the <code>ethernet_common</code>
interface:
</p><p>

   </p><pre class="jdocu_small">SIM_INTERFACE(ethernet_common) {
        void (*frame)(conf_object_t *NOTNULL obj, const frags_t *frame,
                      eth_frame_crc_status_t crc_status);
};
#define ETHERNET_COMMON_INTERFACE "ethernet_common"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
   
</p><p>
For sending frames, an Ethernet device must provide an object attribute, i.e.,
a DML <code>connect</code>, that expects an object implementing
the <code>ethernet_common</code> interface. Sending a frame consists in
calling the <b><i>frame()</i></b> function with the object, the frame (as
a <code>frags_t</code>) and the CRC status for the frame.
</p><p>
For receiving frames, an Ethernet device must simply implement itself
the <code>ethernet_common</code> interface. The link will call the device
whenever it receives a frame, with the same information as above.
</p><p>
Ethernet frames sent via the <code>ethernet_common</code> interface should
not contain any preamble nor SFD (Start Frame Delimiter), but they should
contain all fields, CRC included. The frame is represented as
a <code>frags_t</code>, which is described in section <a class="reference" href="frags_t.html">20</a>.
</p><p>
Because of the cost of computing valid CRC fields in a simulation environment,
the simulated Ethernet links make it possible to optimize away the CRC and
assume it is correct. Setting <i>crc_status</i>
to <code>Eth_Frame_CRC_Match</code> indicates to the link that, regardless of
the actual contents of the CRC field in <i>frame</i>, the CRC is
considered matching the frame contents. In other words, whenever the frame is
assumed to be correct in the simulation (on an Ethernet network without error),
the CRC field of the frame can be left uncomputed,
and <code>Eth_Frame_CRC_Match</code> passed to the link.
</p><p>
Setting <i>crc_status</i> to <code>Eth_Frame_CRC_Mismatch</code>
indicates that, on contrary, the CRC field and the frame contents do not
agree. The CRC field must then be filled with a non-matching CRC value, to make
sure that any simulated hardware or software handling the problem will
correctly obtain a mismatched CRC.
</p><p>
Finally, <i>crc_status</i> can be left
as <code>Eth_Frame_CRC_Unknown</code>. This will force the link to compute
the CRC and reset the status as either a match or a mismatch. This can be
useful when receiving already prepared frames that have been computed by
software or another device. Note that the link itself will never send to the
device an <code>Eth_Frame_CRC_Unknown</code> status.
</p><p>
A complete description of the <code>ethernet_common</code> interface is
provided in the <em>API Reference Manual</em>.
</p><p>

<p>

</p><p>
Ethernet devices are connected to their link via a temporary endpoint
object. This endpoint object provides the device with a private object to talk
to, as well as a well-defined endpoint id on the link. This is used by the link
when routing or switching packets. The simplest way to connect a device to a
link is to use components, which will abstract away the endpoint object
creation and configuration.
</p><p>
To connect to a link, a component encapsulating an Ethernet device should
provide a connector of type <code>ethernet-link</code>. The connector information
to pass along is a list containing either the device object itself, as
[<em>device object</em>], or the device object and its port as a pair, if the
device provides a port connection, as [[<em>device
object</em>, <em>port</em>]]. This will provide sufficient information for the
endpoint to talk with the device. In return, the endpoint will provide itself
as object for connection to the link, as [<em>endpoint object</em>].
</p><p>
A complete type description of the <code>ethernet-link</code> connector is in
section <a class="reference" href="creating-configurations.html#cmp-connector-types">24.10</a>.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Ethernet-Transceiver">22.3 Ethernet Transceiver</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
It is also possible—even recommended—to base a new
Ethernet device model on an existing transceiver. The transceiver will
connect to the link and handle the <code>ethernet_common</code>
interface. In return, it will provide standard features for a
transceiver model, such as bandwidth control and MII registers, and
expose the <code>ieee_802_3_phy_v3</code> to the device for
communication. The device itself must implement
the <code>ieee_802_3_mac_v3</code> interface for receiving
information from the transceiver.
</p><p>
The DEC21140A device model is built with a separate transceiver and
provides a good example of this approach. It is described in section
<a class="reference" href="example-models.html#examples-DEC21140A-dml">10.3</a>.
</p><p>
In most cases, the <b>generic_eth_phy</b> device can be used
as an Ethernet transceiver.  The device is described in section
<a class="reference" href="example-models.html#examples-generic_eth_phy">10.4</a>.
</p><p>
It may in some cases be desirable not to expose the transceiver as a
separate device, and instead let the Ethernet device communicate
directly with a link endpoint.  The <b>generic_eth_phy</b>
device is actually a good example of how to communicate with a link
endpoint, even though it is not a standalone Ethernet device.
