<p>

</p><p>
Simics provides extensive support for tracing and modifying memory transactions
coming out of a processor. This chapter aims at describing how to access memory
transactions programmatically to write extensions such as trace tools, timing
models or cache simulation.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Tracing-Instruction-Execution">43.1 Tracing Instruction Execution</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
All processor models in Simics offer an interface that provides a registered
listener with all executed instructions. This is used by
the <b>trace</b> module, among others, to produce its execution
trace.
</p><p>
Registering a function to listen to a trace interface is simple. Assuming
that <b>cpu</b> is the traced processor, the following code will register
the function <b><i>trace_listener()</i></b> to be called for each instruction
executed by <b>cpu</b>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">void *data_for_trace_listener = some_data;
const exec_trace_interface_t *iface = 
        SIM_c_get_interface(cpu, EXEC_TRACE_INTERFACE);
iface-&gt;register_tracer(cpu, trace_listener, data_for_trace_listener);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Turning off tracing is just as simple:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">void *data_for_trace_listener = some_data;
const exec_trace_interface_t *iface =
        SIM_c_get_interface(cpu, EXEC_TRACE_INTERFACE);
iface-&gt;unregister_tracer(cpu, trace_listener, data_for_trace_listener);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The listener function itself is expected to be defined as
an <code>instruction_trace_callback_t</code>, defined as follow:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">typedef void (*instruction_trace_callback_t)(lang_void *tracer_data,
                                             conf_object_t *cpu,
                                             linear_address_t la,
                                             logical_address_t va,
                                             physical_address_t pa,
                                             byte_string_t opcode);</pre><p>

</p><p>
It takes the following arguments:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:tracer_data"><b>tracer_data</b></dt><dd>The exact pointer passed as <i>tracer_data</i>
when registering the listener function with <b><i>register_tracker()</i></b>.</dd><dt id="dt:cpu"><b>cpu</b></dt><dd>The cpu executing the instruction.</dd><dt id="dt:la"><b>la</b></dt><dd>The linear address of the instruction for x86 processors, and
nothing for all others.</dd><dt id="dt:va"><b>va</b></dt><dd>The virtual address of the instruction as contained in the
program counter, or instruction pointer register.</dd><dt id="dt:pa"><b>pa</b></dt><dd>The physical address of the instruction after doing a MMU
lookup.</dd><dt id="dt:opcode"><b>opcode</b></dt><dd>The bytes composing the instruction.</dd></dl><p>Tracer functions are not expected to return any value to Simics.
</p><p>
The <b>trace</b> module is provided along with Simics, both as a
binary and source code. It is an excellent starting point for developing new
tracing modules.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Tracing-Memory-Transactions">43.2 Tracing Memory Transactions</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This section expects the reader to be familiar with <em>memory spaces</em> and
how memory accesses are directed to the correct device or memory. More
information on memory spaces is available in chapter
<a class="reference" href="memory-space.html">23</a>.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="mem-transactions">43.2.1 Observing Memory Transactions</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="memory-spaces"></a>
</p><p>
Memory-spaces provide a <em>memory hierarchy interface</em> for observing and
modifying memory transactions passing through them. This interface is in fact
composed of two different interfaces acting at different phases of a memory
transaction execution:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>The <code>timing_model</code> interface provides access to a transaction
<em>before</em> it has been executed (i.e., it has just arrived at the
memory-space).
<p>
To connect an object to the timing model interface, just set the
<i>timing_model</i> attribute of the corresponding memory-space with the
value of the object you want to connect:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>@conf.phys_mem0.timing_model = conf.listening_object</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The timing model interface can also be used to change the timing and
the execution of a memory transaction, as well as to modify the value
of a store going to memory. This is described in more detail in
section <a class="reference" href="#changing-mem-trans">43.3.2</a>.</p></li>

<li>The <code>snoop_memory</code> interface provides access to a transaction
<em>after</em> it has been executed.
<p>
Connecting an object to the snoop memory interface is done in the same way as
for the timing model interface:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>@conf.phys_mem0.snoop_device = conf.listening_object</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The <b><a name="trace">trace</a></b> module, for example, automatically
connects itself (or rather one of its objects) to this interface when a trace
is started. The advantage of using this interface is that the value of load
operations is accessible, since the operation has already been performed.
</p><p>
The snoop memory interface can also be used to modify the value of a load
operation. This is described in more detail in section
<a class="reference" href="#changing-mem-trans">43.3.2</a>.</p></li>

</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Both interfaces can be used simultaneously, even by the same object. This
property is used by the <b>trace</b> module, which is in fact
connected both to the timing_model and the snoop_memory interfaces. The reason
for this double connection is explained in section
<a class="reference" href="#stc-description">43.2.4</a>.</div>Information about implementing these two interfaces is available in section
<a class="reference" href="#iim-implementing">43.2.6</a> and section <a class="reference" href="#changing-mem-trans">43.3.2</a>.
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Observing-Instruction-Fetches">43.2.2 Observing Instruction Fetches</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
For performance reasons, <a name="instruction-fetches">instruction fetches</a> are not sent to the
memory hierarchy by default.
</p><p>


</p><p>
Instruction fetches can be activated for each processor with the
<b>&lt;cpu&gt;.instruction-fetch-mode</b> command. It can take several
values:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:no-instruction-fetch"><b><i>no-instruction-fetch</i></b></dt><dd>No instruction fetches are sent to the memory hierarchy interface.</dd><dt id="dt:instruction-cache-access-trace"><b><i>instruction-cache-access-trace</i></b></dt><dd>An instruction fetch is sent every time a different cache line is accessed
by the processor. The size of the cache line is set by the processor attribute
<i>instruction_fetch_line_size</i>.
<p>
This option is meant to be used for cache simulation where successive accesses
to the same cache line do not modify the cache state.</p></dd><dt id="dt:instruction-fetch-trace"><b><i>instruction-fetch-trace</i></b></dt><dd>All instruction fetches are sent to the memory hierarchy interface. This
option is often implemented as <i>instruction-cache-access-trace</i> with a
line size equal to the size of one instruction.
<p>
This option is meant to provide a complete trace of fetch transactions.</p></dd></dl><p>Finally, instruction fetch transactions are not generated by all processor
models. The section <a class="reference" href="#feature-list-stall-cache">43.4</a> contains a summary
of which features are available on which models.
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Observing-Page-table-Accesses">43.2.3 Observing Page-table Accesses</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
For performance reasons, page-table reads are not sent to the memory
hierarchy by default on some CPU models. For PPC models with classic
MMU, you have to set the <code>mmu_mode</code> attribute to get page-table
reads. See the attribute description in the Reference Manual for more
information.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="stc-description">43.2.4 Simulator Translation Cache (STC)</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="STC"></a><a name="MMU"></a>
</p><p>
In order to improve the speed of the simulation, Simics does not perform all
accesses through the memory spaces. The Simulator Translation Caches (STCs) try
to serve most memory operations directly by caching relevant information. In
particular, an STC is intended to contain the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The current logical-to-physical translation for the address;</li>
<li>A count of number of accesses to the address.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The general idea is that the STC will contain information about "harmless"
memory addresses, i.e., addresses where an access would not cause any device
state change or side-effect. A particular memory address is mapped by the STC
only if:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The given logical-to-physical mapping is valid.</li>
<li>An access would not affect the MMU (TLB) state.</li>
<li>There are no breakpoints, callbacks, etc associated with the address.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Memory transactions targeting devices are also mapped by the STC.</div>The contents of the STCs can be flushed at any time, so models using them to
improve speed can not rely on a specific address being cached. They can
however let the STCs cache addresses when further accesses to these addresses
do not change the state of the model (this is used by cache simulation with
<b>g-cache</b>; see the <em>Cache Simulation</em> chapter
in the <em>Analyzer User's Guide</em>).
<p>
The STCs are activated by default. They can be turned on or off at the command
prompt, using the <b>stc-enable/disable</b> functions. An object connected
to the <code>timing_model</code> interface can also mark a memory transaction
so that it will not be cached by the STCs. For example,
the <b>trace</b> module uses that method to ensure that no memory
transaction will be cached, so that the trace will be complete.
</p><p>
Note that since information is inserted into the STCs when transactions are
executed, only objects connected to the <i>timing model</i> interface can
influence the STCs' behavior. The section <a class="reference" href="#modifying-memtrans">43.3</a>
provides a complete description of the changes authorized on a memory
transaction when using the memory hierarchy interface.

The <code><a name="timing_model">timing_model</a></code> and

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Chaining-Timing-Models">43.2.7 Chaining Timing Models</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="timing-modelchaining"></a>
</p><p>
Sometimes it is desirable to chain timing models, e.g., if you are implementing
a multi-level cache model and want to model each level of the cache as an
individual class. To do this, the <b><i>operate()</i></b> function must call the
corresponding functions of the lower levels (a <i>lower</i> or <i>next</i>
level cache means a cache further away from the CPU, closer to the
actual memory).
</p><p>
The <a name="cachesg-cache"></a> <code>g-cache</code> source code included with Simics
is an example of how to do this. Whenever there is a miss in the cache, the
<b>g-cache</b> object creates a new memory operation and calls the
<b><i>operate()</i></b> method of the <code>timing_model</code> interface from
the next level cache specified by the <i>timing_model</i> attribute.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Stalling-Transactions">43.3.1 Stalling Transactions</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The precision of the simulation can be improved by adding timing controls for
memory operations: memory-related instructions are no longer atomic operations,
but actually take virtual time to execute.
</p><p>
Stalling is controlled via the <code>timing_model</code> interface. The
interface simply allows the implementer to return a non-zero number of cycles
to <em>stall</em> before the transaction is allowed to progress. During this
time, the processor is given back control and lets time advance until the
transaction's stall time has elapsed. The transaction is then reissued to the
memory system.
</p><p>
Stalling a transaction is not always possible, depending on the processor model
you are using in the simulation. The section <a class="reference" href="#feature-list-stall-cache">43.4</a> explains what is available for each model.
</p><p>
Cache models, described in the <em>Analyzer User's Guide</em>, are good
examples of complex timing models. Finally, the <em>Understanding Simics
Timing</em> application note goes into more details in the exact way Simics
handles timing and multiprocessor systems.

<p>

</p><p>
An object listening on the <code>timing_model</code> interface is
presented with memory transactions before they have been executed, and
may therefore change both their semantics and their timing. Here is a
list of changes that a timing model is authorized to perform:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:sim_mem_op_may_stall"><b><b><i><a name="SIM_mem_op_may_stall">SIM_mem_op_may_stall</a></i></b></b></dt><dd>Before attempting to stall a memory transaction, the timing model
should call this function to check if a transaction is
stallable. Typically only the first memory operation of a complex
instruction is stallable. Page-crossing transactions and page-table
walks are unstallable too. The timing model could accumulate stall
time for these and stall after the current instruction has completed
instead, see the <b><i>SIM_stall_cycle</i></b> function.
</dd><dt id="dt:sim_set_mem_op_reissue"><b><b><i><a name="SIM_set_mem_op_reissue">SIM_set_mem_op_reissue</a></i></b></b></dt><dd>If set, and the memory hierarchy is stalling, the memory
transaction will be sent again to the timing model after the stalling
was performed. If not set, the transaction will be executed without
further calls to the timing model.</dd><dt id="dt:sim_mem_op_ensure_future_visibility"><b><b><i><a name="SIM_mem_op_ensure_future_visibility">SIM_mem_op_ensure_future_visibility</a></i></b></b></dt><dd>If called, the transaction will not be cached in the STCs,
ensuring that the next access to the same memory area will be sent to
the timing model. Otherwise the next access to that area of memory
may not be sent to the memory hierarchy at all. The address
granularity for this purpose is given by the
<i>min_cacheline_size</i> processor attribute, and is always a
power of 2 no greater than the MMU page size.</dd><dt id="dt:memory-store-value"><b>Memory Store Value</b></dt><dd>Since the memory operation has not been
executed yet, it is possible to change the value of a store operation in the
timing model. However, it is important to <em>restore the original value</em>
in the snoop device once the operation has been performed. The
<b><i><a name="SIM_get_mem_op_value">SIM_get_mem_op_value</a>()</i></b> and
<b><i><a name="SIM_set_mem_op_value">SIM_set_mem_op_value</a>()</i></b> functions (and their variants) can
be used to get and set the value of a given memory transaction.</dd><dt id="dt:stalling-the-memory-transaction"><b>Stalling the Memory Transaction</b></dt><a name="stalling"></a>
<dd>When an object attached to the <em>timing_model</em> interface receives a
memory-transaction, it is allowed to modify the timing of the transaction by
returning a <em>stall time</em> (as a number of processor cycles). This
behavior is a key to modeling caches and memory hierarchies in Simics.
<p>
By returning a non-zero number of cycles from the <b><i>operate()</i></b>
function, Simics will stall the memory transaction that was passed as argument
for that amount of time.</p></dd></dl><p>If a zero stall time is returned, some additional operations are
allowed:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:sim_set_mem_op_exception"><b><b><i><a name="SIM_set_mem_op_exception">SIM_set_mem_op_exception</a></i></b></b></dt><dd>If set to an exception, the transaction will be interrupted and an
exception will be taken. Default is no exception
(<code>Sim_PE_No_Exception</code>).</dd><dt id="dt:sim_set_mem_op_user_data"><b><b><i><a name="SIM_set_mem_op_user_data">SIM_set_mem_op_user_data</a></i></b></b></dt><dd>This <code>void *</code> pointer is not touched by Simics during
the memory operation execution. It can be used to pass information
from a timing model to a snoop device.</dd></dl><p></p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
A transaction may go through several memory-spaces in
hierarchical order before being executed. Each of these memory-spaces
may have a timing-model connected to them. However, if the transaction
is stalled by one timing model, other timing models connected to other
memory spaces may see the transaction being reissued before it is
executed. It is not supported to return a non zero stall time from
these other timing models, that is, a transaction may be stalled by at
most one timing model.</div>
<h4 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="In-a-Snoop-Device">In a Snoop Device</a></h4>
<p>

</p><p>
An object listening on the <code><a name="snoop_memory2">snoop_memory</a></code> interface is
presented with memory transactions after they have completed. It cannot
influence the execution of the operation and it may not return a non-zero value
for stalling, but it is allowed to modify the value of the memory operation.
Since the data returned by read operations are available at this stage, the
snoop device is also an ideal place to trace memory transactions.  Note that if
you want to modify the properties of the memory transaction, such as future
visibility and reissue, you have to do that in a  <code>timing_model</code>
interface <b><i>operate</i></b> function. 
</p><p>
The following actions are allowed:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:change-a-memory-store-value"><b>Change a Memory Store Value</b></dt><dd>If the value of a memory store has
been changed in the timing model, it should be reset in the
snoop device.</dd><dt id="dt:change-a-memory-load-value"><b>Change a Memory Load Value</b></dt><dd>Since the operation has been performed,
the snoop device is the right place to change the value of a load. This is done
with the usual <b><i>SIM_get/set_mem_op_value()</i></b> functions.</dd></dl><p>
