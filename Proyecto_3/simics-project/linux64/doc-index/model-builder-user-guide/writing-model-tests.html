This chapter describes how to write functional tests for
device models using the test framework in Simics Model Builder. The
test framework supports device model testing as well as testing entire
target systems, but this chapter focuses on the former.
</p><p>
Tests are written in Python and can be run as part of building your
devices, or as a separate step. The basics of writing and running
tests are described in the <em>Overview</em> chapter. This chapter goes
into more detail, but assumes that you know the basics described in
that chapter.
</p><p>
The <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> contains more detailed
information about the testing framework in Simics, including the API of
the libraries used in this chapter, as well as the command line
program <i>test-runner</i> that allows the user to run tests in a project
in a flexible way.
</p><p>
Functional tests of a device model should only test the model under
test. This means that they should depend on as little as possible of
the surrounding system. The test framework includes a Python library
called <b>dev_util</b> which helps you achieve this goal. It
provides ways to interact with the device model and to fake the parts
of the system the device model interacts with.
</p><p>
Testing should be an integrated part of normal device model
development, preferably written before the implementation. Beyond the
basic regression testing that automated tests give you, writing tests
first helps you catch errors quickly, and helps you focus the
implementation effort and design.
</p><p>
This chapter starts with an overview of the testing process. Then it
shows you where to find some example models which include tests.
Finally it goes into more detail about how to write tests.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Overview">16.1 Overview</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The basics of a functional test of a device model is to write Python
code which interacts with the device in a way that other parts of a
real system would and to check that the device behaves as expected.
</p><p>
The most basic form of interaction with a device is reading and
writing its registers. You can also interact with a device by calling
methods in interfaces it implements. To check that the device behaves
as expected, you check that the register accesses and interface calls
have the expected results. A device may also perform its own interface
calls as a side effect of register accesses or interface calls, for
example to access memory, raise interrupt signals, or send network
packets. To verify this, add fake objects implementing the interfaces
and check that the device performs the expected calls.
The <b>dev_util</b> library helps with this interfacing with
the model. The <b>stest</b> is used to check that the
results are as expected.
</p><p>
Some Simics objects that a device model collaborates with cannot be
easily faked. Models depending on timing, for example models which
implement timers, or models timing when performing DMA, need a clock
to keep track of the time and handle events. This is easier to do with
an instance of the <b>clock</b> class instead of trying to
fake it.
</p><p>
If a model uses an <b>image</b> object to store large data
structures, it is easiest to consider this an internal implementation
detail and provide a real <b>image</b> image in the test.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Sample-Tests">16.2 Sample Tests</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics Model Builder includes a couple of sample devices which include
tests: <b>DS12887</b> and <b>DEC21140A-dml</b>. The
tests do not cover all the functionality, but are provided as a
demonstration of basic test techniques. To get access to the tests,
run the following:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project$ <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=DS12887</b></pre><p>
and
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project$ <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=DEC21140A-dml</b></pre><p>
Now you can try running the tests:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project$ <b>make test</b></pre><p>
</p><p>
After copying, the tests can be found in
the <code>[project]/modules/DS12887/test</code>
and <code>[project]/modules/DS12887/test</code> directories.
</p><p>
The <b>DS12887</b> suite consists of three tests, sharing some
definitions from a common Python file (<code>common.py</code>). Each
test sets up a simple configuration consisting of an instance of the
device and a small number of other objects. No actual processor is
used; a clock object is used to allow time to pass.
</p><p>
The <b>DEC21140A-dml</b> suite contains similar tests for the
DEC21140A Ethernet controller. These tests are far from exhaustive,
but they demonstrate more in depth the techniques of testing a device
interacting with other objects; these objects are faked in the test.
The suite also shows how to check that the interface calls performed
by the model happen in the expected order.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Writing-Tests">16.3 Writing Tests</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The key to useful functional tests of a device model is to test the
<em>entire</em> model, but <em>only</em> the model. That is, the set-up
for each test should not be bigger than needed.
</p><p>
When you use <code>project-setup</code> to create a new device
skeleton, you also get a test template in the <code>test</code>
directory of the device. You should extend this template with your
functional tests for the model.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Anatomy-of-a-Test-Suite">16.3.1 Anatomy of a Test Suite</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
A test suite for a Simics module is placed in the <code>test</code>
directory of the module's source. It has the following contents:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:suiteinfo"><b><code>SUITEINFO</code></b></dt><dd>The existence of this file is what tells the test system that the
  directory contains a test suite. It needs to exist, but can be
  empty. It can optionally contain configuration parameters for the
  test suite, but it is usually empty.
</dd><dt id="dt:readme-or-readme-txt"><b><code>README</code> or <code>README.txt</code></b></dt><dd>An optional file, which is ignored by the test system. It should
  contain a description of the suite, in human-readable format.
</dd><dt id="dt:tests-py"><b><code>tests.py</code></b></dt><dd>An optional file which generates the set of tests in the suite. If
  it does not exist, the test system will automatically generate a
  test for every file named <code>s-*.py</code>, where <code>*</code> can
  be any string. This is usually all that is needed for functional
  tests of modules.
</dd><dt id="dt:s-py"><b><code>s-*.py</code></b></dt><dd>Each file whose name matches this pattern is by default considered a
  test by the test system, and will be run in its own Simics process.
</dd></dl><p>This is just a high level description of the files in a test suite.  See
the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> for the details.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Configuration">16.3.2 Configuration</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Ideally, only one instance of the model under test should be needed
for each test. In this case, just create the instance
using <b><i>SIM_add_configuration</i></b>.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">my_dev = pre_conf_object('dev', 'my_dev_class_name')
my_dev.attr1 = 'foo'
my_dev.attr2 = 4711

SIM_add_configuration([my_dev], None)

# Replace our pre_conf_object reference with
# a reference to the Simics obj
my_dev = conf.my_dev
</pre><p>
</p><p>
In practice the device model may require connections to other models.
These models can frequently be <em>faked</em>. This means that instead
of creating the objects that would normally be used, an extremely
simple class that only implements the necessary interfaces is
used. This can usually be done in Python.
</p><p>
For example, many devices need to be able to signal interrupts.
Normally an actual interrupt controller object, implementing the
<code>signal</code> interface, is used. When testing, it is
advantageous to create a small class implementing the same interface
using <b>dev_util</b>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import stest
import dev_util

# Subclass the signal interface class
class PicIface(dev_util.iface("signal")):
    def signal_raise(self, sim_obj):
        self.raised = True

    def signal_lower(self, sim_obj):
        self.raised = False
        self.spikes = 0

# Create a device instance implementing the PicIface interface
fake_pic = dev_util.Dev([PicIface])
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Create such fake objects before the model under test. Then you can
configure the model under test to connect to the fake object. Please
note that you must use the <code>obj</code> member of the fake object:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"># Initialize the interrupt lines we will be checking later
fake_pic.signal.raised = False
fake_pic.signal.spikes = 0

my_dev = pre_conf_object('dev', 'my_dev_class_name')
my_dev.pic = fake_pic.obj

SIM_add_configuration([my_dev], None)
my_dev = conf.my_dev

# Run test code
...

# Verify that interrupts were raised
stest.expect_equal(fake_pic.signal.raised, True, 'signal not raised')
stest.expect_equal(fake_pic.signal.spikes, 5,
                   'not expected number of signal spikes')
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The advantages of using fake objects compared to actual models are:
</p><ul>
 <li>
  fake objects can be made to react to method calls to verify that the
  interfaces are used in the expected way;
 </li>
 <li>
  it reduces the code being tested to the device in question, without
  relying on the correctness of other code; and
 </li>
 <li>
  it simplifies the configuration, as a single fake object can often
  replace several different objects by implementing all the needed
  interfaces.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
Objects that cannot be faked are those that cannot be implemented in
Python because they use data types that cannot be translated from C.
</p><p>
For instance, some methods in the <code>memory_space</code>
interface cannot be used from Python as they take <code>uint8 *</code>
arguments. The <b>dev_util</b> library provides
a <b>Memory</b> which can be used instead. This is described
in section <a class="reference" href="#memory-accesses">16.3.4</a>.
</p><p>
If the device uses an internal interface (for example, devices communicating
with other devices on the same SoC), it is often possible to wrap the interface
to make it usable by Python. See chapter <em>Defining a New Interface Type</em>
in this guide. Then you can use <b>dev_util</b> to wrap them as any
other interface.
</p><p>
If you cannot wrap an interface in Python, you can write a simple
device in DML which translates between pseudo attributes and interface
calls instead, or translates between an unwrappable interface and a
wrappable one.
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Accessing-Device-Registers-from-Tests">16.3.3 Accessing Device Registers from Tests</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
When a configuration has been created, it is time to perform the
actual tests. This requires the device to be configured, usually
through register writes.
</p><p>
Thus we need a way of writing to the device. Attributes are not
recommended for this, and will in most cases not work anyway, as
attribute setters have no side-effects. The <code>io_memory</code>
interface, which is used for register accesses, cannot be accessed
from Python. This means we must generate transactions through a memory
space into which we have mapped the device.
</p><p>
The <b>dev_util</b> library handles this as well. It allows
you to define Python registers that wrap the registers of the
device. It even allows you to map a bit field on top of the register,
making it possible to read or write a specific field without
masking/shifting the entire register value.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import dev_util
from stest import expect_equal

my_device = pre_conf_object('dev', 'my_device_class')
SIM_add_configuration([my_device], None)

# Register 'foo' at offset 0x40 in bank 'pci_config'
reg_foo = dev_util.Register_BE((conf.dev,     # object
                                'pci_config', # bank
                                0x40),        # offset in bank
                               size=4)        # register size

# Another register with a bit field
reg_bar = dev_util.Register_BE(
    (conf.dev, 'regs', 2), size=2,
    bitfield = dev_util.Bitfield_LE(
        {'ichi' : 15,        # Bit 15
         'ni'   : 14,        # Bit 14
         'san'  : 13,        # Bit 13
         'yon'  : (12, 8),   # Bits 12-8
         'go'   : (7, 0)}))  # Bits 7-0

# Writing the entire register
reg_foo.write(0xdeadbeef)
expect_equal(reg_foo.read(), 0xdeadbeef)

# Writing bit fields; only the specified fields will be updated,
# the rest will keep their current values
reg_bar.write(ichi = 1, ni = 0, go = 0x7)

# Quick access to a single field
reg_bar.san = 1
reg_bar.yon = 0x6

# Of course, we can read/write the entire register as well
reg_bar.write(0x47)
reg_bar.read()
</pre><p>
</p><p>
As can be seen, registers can either have little- or big-endian byte
order
(<b>Register_LE</b>/<b>Register_BE</b>). Similarly,
bitfields can either have little- or bit-endian bit-order
(<b>Bitfield_LE</b>/<b>Bitfield_BE</b>). LE/BE
registers can be freely mixed with LE/BE bit fields. This works
analogously to registers and fields in DML. You can read more about
byte order and bit order in <em>Byte Order and Byte Swapping in
Simics</em>.
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="memory-accesses">16.3.4 Responding to Memory Accesses From Models</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
It is quite common that a device performs DMA transfers. These
transfers are often configured with descriptors, i.e., in-memory
structures that tell the device how to perform the transfer (e.g.,
size and location of the transfer). A network controller would be a
typical example of such a device. Network controllers are usually
configured with receive and transmit descriptors.
</p><p>
The <b>dev_util</b> library provides two classes that makes
it easier to test DMA transfers: the <b>Memory</b> class and
the <b>Layout</b> class.
</p><p>
The <b>Memory</b> class replaces a <b>memory-space</b>
and <b>ram</b> configuration. The advantage of using
the <b>Memory</b> class over regular Simics RAM is twofold:
it is possible to track which addresses have been written to; and you
will get an exception if test code, or a device, tries to read from
uninitialized addresses.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import dev_util
from stest import expect_equal, expect_different

mem = dev_util.Memory()
dma_dev = pre_conf_object('dev', 'my_dev_class')
dma_dev.phys_mem = mem.obj
SIM_add_configuration([dma_dev], None)

# Create a layout at address 0x1234.
# The descriptor looks like this:
#
#      --------------------
#  0:  |  reg1   |  reg2  |
#      --------------------
#  4:  |       reg3       |
#      --------------------
#  8:  | f1 | f2 |////////|
#      --------------------
#
# Total descriptor size is 10 bytes.

desc = dev_util.Layout_LE(
    mem, 0x1234,
    {'reg1' : (0, 2),  # offset = 0, size = 2
     'reg2' : (2, 2),  # offset = 2, size = 2
     'reg3' : (4, 4),
     'reg4' : (8, 2,
               dev_util.Bitfield_BE({'f1' : (15, 8),
                                     'f2' : (7, 0)})
              )})

# Initialize the descriptor
desc.reg1 = 0xffff
desc.reg2 = 0xabab
desc.reg3 = 0xdeadbeef
desc.reg4.write(0, f1=5, f2=27)

# Fill memory with test data (this is the data the device
# will read, in addition to the descriptor above).
mem.write(0xabab, tuple(i for i in xrange(256)))

# Run test
...

# If the device updates the descriptor with status information,
# we should check that now
expect_different(desc.reg4.f2, 29)

# Check that data was copied from 0xabab to 0xffff
expect_equal(mem.read(0xffff, 256), range(256)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
One thing that should be noted is that it is not possible to access
(read from or write to) a field in an uninitialized register. This is
because the entire register must be loaded before altering a single
field, and the <b>Memory</b> class will raise an exception
when reading uninitialized memory. To handle this, either do a write
to the entire register before setting the field, or set all the fields
in a single write operation with a default value of, for example,
zero:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">layout.reg.write(0)
layout.reg.field = 1
</pre><p>
or
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">layout.reg.write(0, field=1)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Test-Coverage-and-Speed">16.3.5 Test Coverage and Speed</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Tests should obviously be as complete as possible, covering all the
implemented functionality of a device model. Anything that is
implemented but not tested risks to stop working at any moment due to
later changes to the code.
</p><p>
On the other hand, it is important to make tests complete quickly.
Ideally, a programmer should be able to re-run all tests for a device
model even after small changes, without having to wait a long time for
the tests to finish. If the tests take too long, they will not be run
as often and will then be less effective in helping development.
</p><p>
As a rule of thumb, the time taken by a test should be dominated by
the Simics start up time, and all tests of a single device model no
more than half a minute, preferably even shorter. Most device tests
should only take a few seconds on a modern machine. Exceptions should
only be allowed if there are very good reasons for them.
</p><p>
This means that not everything can be tested, but clever testing can
cover a lot of functionality in a short time.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Documenting-Tests">16.3.6 Documenting Tests</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
For tests to be useful and maintainable, you should document what is
being tested, both for the entire test suite (in a <code>README</code>
file) and each test (as comments in the respective files). Any
omissions should be noted; this is important to assess coverage.
</p><p>
The test code itself is subject to the same commenting as any other
program code; i.e., describe anything unusual and the reasoning behind
the design, but do not over-comment the code itself.
</p><p>
When a test fails, it must be reasonably easy to find out exactly what
has failed and why. This can be achieved by a combination of error
messages when the failure occurs, logging done during the test run,
and comments in the test code. Raising a Python exception at the point
of error also helps locating it, since a complete traceback will be
printed automatically. The checking functions
in <b>stest</b> already raise exceptions if the check fails.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Arranging-Test-Code">16.3.7 Arranging Test Code</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
When dividing tests into subtests, the following should be taken into account:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
 <li>
  A subtest is in general the unit for reporting failures or successes.
  It is often useful to put tests of independent features into separate
  subtests, so they can fail and succeed independently of each other.
 </li>

 <li>
   A subtest is run in its own Simics process which means that it is
   started in a known state. This removes any dependencies on previous
   tests.
 </li>

 <li>
  It takes some time for Simics to start, so it often makes sense to
  put many related small tests into the same subtest script, in order
  to make the test run faster.
 </li>
</ul>
<p>
As with all programming, it is always a good idea to factor out common
test code into separate Python files. This can include configuration,
definition of fake objects, functions for register access and other
helper functions. See the sample tests for how it can be done.
