<p>

One advantage of a simulated target is the ability to inspect and control it
in ways that are not possible on real hardware. The Simics hap system gives
the user access to important events in the system and there are ways to trace
all memory accesses and for processor initiated accesses even adjust their
timing. Similarly, network packets and other bus traffic can be inspected. It
is often also possible to inject and change data in the system, both for
debugging and testing purposes, such as sending or modifying network packages,
changing register values or memory contents. This chapter and the text
describes some of the mechanisms available and also gives examples of how they
can be used, but there are many other possibilities, such as creating real
world connections, covered in more detail in chapter
<a class="reference" href="external-world.html">44</a>.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-Haps-to-Catch-Simulator-Events">42.1 Using Haps to Catch Simulator Events</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="haps"></a>
As described in the <em>Simics User's Guide</em>, a hap is an event in
Simics that, when occurring, will call any callback functions installed for it.
The rich collection of haps in Simics for both simulator and target related
events, including new, user-defined haps, provides the user with powerful
control and inspection capabilities.
</p><p>
Some haps are system global, such as the hap triggered when the simulator
exits, but most are associated with an object. For such haps it is possible to
install the callback to trigger for all objects or only for a selected one.
</p><p>
It is important to know that hap callbacks are run at once when the hap is
triggered. For example, this may be in <em>Cell Context</em>,
when the simulation is running and many API functions can not be run.
(The <em>API Reference
Manual</em> includes a description of all execution contexts and their
restrictions and the reference manuals lists the allowed execution contexts for
all API functions.) To overcome these restrictions, Simics provides several
functions for posting callbacks that are run when the simulator is in a less
restricted state, such as
<b><i>SIM_run_alone</i></b> and <b><i>SIM_run_unrestricted</i></b>.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Reacting-to-Haps">42.1.1 Reacting to Haps</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="SIM_hap_add_callback"></a>
</p><p>
When you want your code to react to a hap occurrence, you can register a
callback function for the specific hap.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b># In Python</b>
SIM_hap_add_callback(hap, func, user_data)

<b>// In C</b>
hap_handle_t
SIM_hap_add_callback(const char *hap, obj_hap_func_t func, lang_void *data);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The parameters of <b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback()</i></b> are:
</p><ul>
<li><i>hap</i>—The name of the hap to install a callback
function on.</li>
<li><i>func</i>—The function to be called when the hap is
triggered. The signature for this callback function differs between haps.</li>
<li><i>user_data</i>—User data that will be passed as-is by
Simics to the callback function.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The function returns a handle which can be used to manipulate the hap callback
later on, typically used to disable it. There are additionally several other
functions that can be used to register a hap callback The <code>_obj</code> kind
installs a callback that only reacts on haps triggered by a specific object.
The <code>_index</code> and <code>_range</code> kinds are used for haps that have an
index associated with them, and is used to only trigger the hap for one or a
range of the indexes. The names of these other functions are
<b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback_index()</i></b>,
<b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback_range()</i></b>, <b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback_obj()</i></b>,
<b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_index()</i></b> and
<b><i>SIM_hap_add_callback_obj_range()</i></b>. See the <em>API Reference
Manual</em> for more information about the differences between them.
</p><p>
A list of all haps can be found in the <em>Simics Reference Manual</em>,
including the signatures for the callback functions. The list can also be
retrieved on the command line using the <b>list-haps</b> command. This
command can also be used to print detailed information about a hap:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>list-haps hap = Core_Simulation_Stopped</b> 
<b>Name</b>
   Core_Simulation_Stopped

<b>Callback Type</b>
   void (*)(lang_void *callback_data, conf_object_t *trigger_obj,
            integer_t exception, char *error_string);

<b>Index</b>
   exception

<b>Installed Handlers</b>
   5

<b>Description</b>
   Triggered when the simulation stops. exception will always be
   SimExc_No_Exception, and error_string will always be NULL. After this hap,
   simulation will not advance (triggering Core_Continuation) until
   SIM_continue() is called again. Callbacks called in Global Context.
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The following is an example of using a hap from C and from Python:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b># In Python</b>
def stopped(user_data, obj, exception, errstr):
    print("Stopped")

def started(user_data, obj):
    print("Started")

handle1 = SIM_hap_add_callback("Core_Continuation", started, None);
handle2 = SIM_hap_add_callback("Core_Simulation_Stopped", stopped, (2, "str"))
<i>[…]</i>

<b>// In C</b>
static void
stopped(void *user_data, conf_object_t *obj, int64 exception, char *errstr)
{
        pr("Stopped\n");
}

static void
started(void *user_data, conf_object_t *obj)
{
        pr("Started\n");
}

static hap_handle_t h1, h2;

void
init_local()
{
        <i>[…]</i>
        h1 = SIM_hap_add_callback("Core_Continuation", started, NULL);
        h2 = SIM_hap_add_callback("Core_Simulation_Stopped", stopped, NULL);
        <i>[…]</i>
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When you no longer want to be notified when a hap triggers, the callback can
be canceled using one of the functions
<b><i><a name="SIM_hap_delete_callback">SIM_hap_delete_callback</a>()</i></b>,
<b><i>SIM_hap_delete_callback_obj()</i></b>,
<b><i>SIM_hap_delete_callback_id()</i></b> and
<b><i>SIM_hap_delete_callback_obj_id()</i></b>. See the <em>API Reference
Manual</em> for the differences. The signature for
<b><i>SIM_hap_delete_callback()</i></b> is:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">SIM_hap_delete_callback(hap, func, user_data)
</pre><p>
Where the parameters are the same as for installing the hap callback. The
exact same parameter must be used as the callback was registered with.
</p><p>
To continue the above example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b># In Python</b>
def at_end():
    # using the callback parameters
    SIM_hap_delete_callback("Core_Simulation_Stopped", stopped, NULL);
    # using the hap handle
    SIM_hap_delete_callback_id("Core_Simulation_Stopped", handle2)

<b>// In C</b>
void
at_end()
{
        // Using the callback parameters
        SIM_hap_delete_callback("Core_Simulation_Stopped", stopped, NULL);
        // Using the hap handle
        SIM_hap_delete_callback_id("Core_Simulation_Stopped", h2);
}
</pre><p>


</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Tracing-Memory-Accesses">42.2 Tracing Memory Accesses</a></h2>
<p>

Simics, when running in <em>stall mode</em> provides tracing mechanisms for
memory accesses, both instruction fetches and data accesses. Most
processor-initiated accesses can also be stalled as a way to control the timing
of the memory sub-system. All of chapter <a class="reference" href="memory-and-timing.html">43</a> is
dedicated to memory tracing and timing in Simics since this is an extensive
subject.
