This chapter shows you how to use the memory spaces in Simics.
Memory spaces is a fundamental abstraction in Simics providing support
for generic 64-bit address spaces into which memory and devices can be
mapped. More concretely a memory space takes a stream of transactions
to an address space and distributes them to devices mapped into the
address space in a highly efficient manner while optionally providing
address translations, byte swapping, and break point support. Memory
space objects can be cascaded to form arbitrarily complex mappings and
support dynamic reconfiguration and remapping at run time through
attributes to support modeling of buses with dynamic addressing.

<p>

</p><p>
Simics memory-spaces are handled by the generic <b>memory-space</b>
class. A <b>memory-space</b> object implements interface functions for
memory accesses, and it has attributes specifying how the mappings are set up.
</p><p>
The most important attribute in a memory-space is the <i>map</i>
attribute.  This is a list of mapped objects that may contain devices, RAM and
ROM objects, and other memory-spaces. In addition to the <i>map</i>
attribute, there is also a <i>default_target</i> attribute that is used
for accesses that do not match any of the targets in the map list.
</p><p>
Python example of a <b>memory-space</b> object where already created
objects are mapped into a new memory space:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">@mem = pre_conf_object('phys_mem', 'memory-space')
@mem.map = [[0x00000000, conf.ram0,    0, 0,          0xa0000],
            [0x000a0000, conf.vga0,    1, 0,          0x20000],
            [0x000c0000, conf.rom0,    0, 0,          0x10000],
            [0x000f0000, conf.rom0,    0, 0,          0x10000],
            [0x00100000, conf.ram0,    0, 0x100000, 0xff00000],
            [0xfee00000, conf.apic0,   0, 0,           0x4000],
            [0xffe81000, conf.hfs0,    0, 0,               16],
            [0xffff0000, conf.rom0,    0, 0,          0x10000]]
@mem.default_target = [conf.pci_mem0, 0, 0, conf.pci_mem0]
@SIM_add_configuration([mem], None)

</p><p>
The fields for an entry in the map list are as follows:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:base"><b>base</b></dt><dd>The start address of the mapping in the memory space.
</dd><dt id="dt:object"><b>object</b></dt><dd>Reference to the mapped object or port. In the
case of an object mapping this is just the object and in the case of a
port mapping it is a two element list: [object, port name]. One common
example for the use of port mappings is mapping banks of DML devices.  </dd><dt id="dt:function"><b>function</b></dt><dd>An object specific identification number for this
mapping. The function number is typically only used by older device models
with several mappings. When such a device is accessed, the function number can
be used to figure out what mapping it was accessed through. Newer device
models use port mappings instead. If a port mapping is used the function
number is not passed on to the target device. The function number is part of
the <code>map_info_t</code> <code>struct</code>, which is passed as a parameter
of all <code>io_memory</code> interface functions.</dd><dt id="dt:offset"><b>offset</b></dt><dd>The start offset in the target object. This is often used
when a memory-space is mapped in another memory-space. Example: memory-space B
is mapped in space A at base 0x4000 with length 0x1000, and with offset
0x2000. If an access is made in space A at address 0x4010, it will be forwarded
to space B at address 0x2010. Without any offset in the mapping, the resulting
address would have been 0x10.  </dd><dt id="dt:length"><b>length</b></dt><dd>The size of the mapping in bytes.
</dd><dt id="dt:target"><b>target</b></dt><dd>(optional) If <em>object</em> is not the final
destination for the access, then <i>target</i> is a reference to the
actual target object or port. It has the same format as
<b>object</b>. This is described in more details in the section about
different mapping types.</dd><dt id="dt:priority"><b>priority</b></dt><dd>(optional) The priority of the mapping. The
highest priority is -32768, and the lowest is 32767; the default is 0.
If mappings overlap, then the priority field specifies what mapping
that has precedence. It is an error if overlapping mappings have the
same priority. Usually overlapping mappings should be avoided, but for
bridges that catch unclaimed accesses in specific address ranges the
priority field is useful. There are also devices that have overlapping
mappings that have different priorities, and in that case the priority
field in the map list can be used.</dd><dt id="dt:align-size"><b>align-size</b></dt><dd>(optional) The <i>align-size</i> can be used
if a target does not support large accesses. Accesses that crosses an alignment
boundary will be split into several transactions by the Simics memory
system. By default this will be set to 4 bytes for port-space devices and 8
bytes for other devices, but it is not used for memory.</dd><dt id="dt:byte-swap"><b>byte-swap</b></dt><dd>(optional) Some device mappings swap the data
bytes in a transaction, to support mixed-endian environments.
Mappings with an <i>align-size</i> of 2, 4, or 8 may set the
<i>byte-swap</i> field to one of 0 to 3 where 0 is <code>none</code>,
1 is <code>bus</code>, 2 is <code>bus-trans</code> and 3 is <code>trans</code>.
As the name suggests,
<code>none</code> performs no swapping while <code>bus</code> swaps data based
on the <i>align-size</i> setting. If any swapping is used,
<code>bus</code> is most common. It is also possible to swap all bytes of
the access based on the access size by using <code>trans</code> and
finally combine the two swappings into <code>bus-trans</code>. As an
example, consider a mapping with a 4-byte align-size and memory at
address 0 that contains the following bytes: <code>0x00 0x01 0x02
0x03</code>. A 2-byte big-endian read access at address 0 will give the
following values as results. No swap: <code>0x0001</code>, bus swap:
<code>0x0302</code>, bus and transaction swap: <code>0x0203</code> and
transaction swap: <code>0x0100</code>.  </dd></dl><p>

<p>

</p><p>
All mappings in a memory-space can be viewed with the
<b>&lt;memory-space&gt;.map</b> command. Example:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt;  board.mb.nb.pci_mem.map
       Base Object                  Fn Offset   Length Target              Prio Align Swap
    0xa0000 board.mb.gpu.dmap_space       0x0  0x20000                        0
    0xc0000 board.mb.shadow               0x0  0x40000 board.mb.shadow_mem    1
 0xfec00000 board.mb.sb.ioapic            0x0     0x20                        0     8
 0xffe00000 board.mb.rom                  0x0 0x200000                        0
  -default- board.mb.dram_space           0x0

Another useful command is <b>devs</b>, that lists all mapped devices in
the system.

</p><p>
It is also possible to modify mappings interactively from the command line, or
from a script, by using the <b>add-map</b> and <b>del-map</b>
memory-space commands. Try <code>help &lt;memory-space&gt;.add-map</code> from the
command line for more information or refer to the <em>API Reference
Manual</em>.
</p><p>
Additionally memory mappings can be viewed in the GUI see <em>Getting
Started</em> or the <em>Simics User's Guide</em> for details.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Memory-Mapping-Use-Cases">23.3 Memory Mapping Use Cases</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
There are a few different kinds of memory mappings.
All use the format described in the previous section.
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:device-mapping"><b>Device Mapping</b></dt><dd>The most common kind of mapping. It
is used for devices, RAM and ROM objects. The <i>target</i> field is
not set. For devices this is often a port mapping.  </dd><dt id="dt:translator-mapping"><b>Translator Mapping</b></dt><dd>Sometimes the address has to be modified between memory-spaces, or the
destination memory-space depends on the address or some other aspect of
the access. In these cases a <i>translator</i>
can be used. A translator mapping is specified with the translator in the
<i>object</i> field, and the default target as <i>target</i>. The translator
has to implement either the <code>translator</code> or
the <code>translate</code> interface. When an access reaches
a translator mapping, the <b><i>translate</i></b> function in the interface
is called. Please refer to the documentation of the <code>translator</code>
and the <code>translate</code> interfaces for more information about their
usage.
</dd><dt id="dt:translate-to-ram-rom-mapping"><b>Translate to RAM/ROM Mapping</b></dt><dd>Used to map RAM and ROM objects with a translator first. The <i>object</i>
field is set to the translator, and <i>target</i> is set to the RAM/ROM object.
</dd><dt id="dt:space-to-space-mapping"><b>Space-to-space Mapping</b></dt><dd>Map one memory-space in another. The <i>object</i> field
is set to the destination memory-space object.
</dd><dt id="dt:bridge-mapping"><b>Bridge Mapping</b></dt><dd>A bridge mapping is typically used for mappings that are set up by some
kind of bridge device. The purpose of a bridge mapping is to handle accesses
where nothing is mapped, in a way that corresponds to the bus architecture.
For a bridge mapping, the <i>object</i> field is set to the bridge device,
implementing the <code>bridge</code> interface. The <i>target</i> field is
set to the destination memory-space. If both a translator
and a bridge are needed,
they must be implemented by the same object. If an access is made where nothing
is mapped, the memory-space by default returns the <code>Sim_PE_IO_Not_Taken</code>
pseudo exception. But if the access was made through a bridge mapping, the
bridge device will be called to notify it about the unmapped access. It can
then update any internal status registers, specify a new return exception,
and set the data that should be returned in the case of a read access. Since
the bridge is associated with the mapping and not the memory-space itself,
several bridges can exist for one space, and devices doing accesses directly
to the memory-space in question will not affect the bridge for non-mapped
addresses. In the latter case, the device itself has to interpret the
<code>Sim_PE_IO_Not_Taken</code> exception. The <code>Sim_PE_IO_Error</code> exception,
indicating that a device returned an error is also sent to the bridge. Finally,
bridges are called for accesses that generate <code>Sim_PE_Inquiry_Outside_Memory</code>,
i.e., an inquiry access where nothing is mapped. In this case the bridge
may have to set a default return value, such as −1.
</dd></dl><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Avoiding-Circular-Mappings">23.4 Avoiding Circular Mappings</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Since memory-spaces can be mapped in other memory-spaces, it is
possible to create loops where accesses never reach any target
device. One typical case is a PCI memory-space with bridges that has
both downstream and upstream mappings. In a real system, the bridge
typically does not snoop its own transactions and there will be no
loop. In Simics there are usually no bridge devices mapped between
different memory-spaces, instead the bridge will create space-to-space
mappings. The bridge has to be careful to avoid addresses which will
cause loops between memory-spaces when accessed.
</p><p>
To catch invalid configurations Simics will make sure that an access
does not loop by terminating it after 512 memory-space transitions. If
this limit is reached, it is considered a configuration error and
Simics will stop.
