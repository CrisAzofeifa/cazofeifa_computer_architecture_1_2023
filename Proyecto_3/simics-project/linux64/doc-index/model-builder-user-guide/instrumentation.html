<p>
  
</p><p>
  Simics instrumentation framework defines a set of new interfaces that
  could be used to add instrumentation. Most of these are optional by
  the design. In principle, the only interface that must be used
  for instrumentation to show up in
  the <b>list-instrumentation</b> command are some Python
  functions in Simics' <b>instrumentation</b> module.
</p><p>
  Currently, the only supported interface for implementing
  instrumentation tools is to use
  the <b><i>instrumentation.make_tool_commands()</i></b> python function.
  This makes it easier to write instrumentation tools, and to automatically
  implement a number of standard commands for those. These commands
  will automatically interface the <b>instrumentation</b>
  "database" which keeps track of currently used instrumentation
  (tools, providers and filters objects connected).
</p><p>
  This factory function should be called from the tool's
  <code>simics_start.py</code> file, which is automatically run when
  Simics starts. The <b><i>instrumentation.make_tool_commands()</i></b>
  function takes many arguments (allowing customization on which commands
  that should be created), but only a few arguments are actually required.
</p><p>
  A tool which make use of
  the <b><i>instrumentation.make_tool_commands()</i></b> function, must
  implement the <code>instrumentation_tool</code>
  interface. The <b><i>instrumentation_tool.connect()</i></b> method
  should return an object pointer with the associated data-structure
  for the connection. As shown in figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex1">16</a>
  and figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex2">17</a>
</p><p>
  </p><div class="figure" id="api-ex1">

      <div class="caption">Figure 17. Multiple connections</div>
  </div></div>

  <p>
  By having a dedicated object for each connection, the tool
  will more easily be able to handle simultaneous calls from
  providers that execute in different threads in Simics.
  This requires that each connection maintains its own connection
  specific data (and not access any connection global data).
  The tool can then fetch the connection specific data from
  all connections and merge these into a unified view for
  the complete result of all connections.
</p><p>
  If a connection is about to be removed,
  the <b><i>instrumentation_tool.disconnect()</i></b> function is
  called. This requests the tool to un-register the connection from
  the provider and to remove the associated connection object, as
  illustrated in figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex4">19</a>.
  </p><p>

      <div class="caption">Figure 18. Disconnecting a tool from a provider</div>
  </div></div>

<p>
  When a connection is created, the framework also creates
  an additional small Simics object of the
  <b>instrumentation_filter_aggregator</b> class. This object
  is what the filters communicate with, when enabling/disabling each
  connection. The aggregator will look at all sources and control
  enabling and disabling with
  the <code>instrumentation_connection</code> interface. The filter
  implements the <code>instrumentation_filter_master</code>
  interface and talks to the aggregator via
  the <code>instrumentation_filter_slave</code> interface. See
  figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex4">19</a>.

<p>
  Figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex5">20</a> shows how the aggregator
  takes input from multiple sources and decides if the
  connection should be enabled or disabled at this time.
  As long as any filter-source is disabled, the connection
  will be disabled.

  </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Instrumentation setup is regarded as per session, that is,
    the connected instrumentation is not saved in any checkpoints.
    This means that the user will need to re-establish the instrumentation
    connections when starting from a checkpoint.
    All instrumentation tools and filters should set
    <code>class_data_t.kind = Sim_Class_Kind_Session</code>.

  The API functions and interfaces that a tool should use are
  located in
  the <code>simics/simulator-iface/instrumentation-tool.h</code>
  header file.
</p><p>
  To get started writing an new instrumentation tool, a skeleton
  can be created by running the following command in the
  project:
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    $ <b>cd <em>my-project</em></b>
    my-project$ <b>./bin/project-setup --instrumentation-tool my_tool</b>
  </pre><p>
  This will create a new <code>modules/my_tool</code> directory containing
  associated required files. Search for <code>USER-TODO</code> markers in
  the generated files for a description on what, and where, additional
  logic needs to be inserted.
  It can also be useful to take a look at the distributed source files
  of example tools, that are included in the package.
</p><p>
  </p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Multithreading-Aspects">40.2.1 Multithreading Aspects</a></h3>
<p>
  
  Tools can be called simultaneously from providers in different
  executing threads. It is up to the tool to handle this parallelism
  itself. The tool has some choices how to handle multi-threading:
  </p><ul>
    <li>In all callbacks, only access data which are associated with
      a specific connection, i.e., the connection object.
      This is safe since a provider will only reside in one thread.
      This is the recommended approach.
    </li>
    <li>Make the tool multi-threading capable, protecting accesses to
      any shared resources with locks, atomic operations, etc.</li>
    <li>Detect if providers are in different cells and refuse to
      support it.</li>
    <li>Enforce that any multi-threading simulation is turned off, in
      order to use the tool.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>

  </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Instrumentation-Filter-API">40.3 Instrumentation Filter API</a></h2>
<p>
  
  The interfaces needed to design a filter is located in the
  <code>simics/simulator-iface/instrumentation-filter.h</code> header
  file.
</p><p>
  To get started writing an new instrumentation filter, a skeleton
  can be created by running the following command in a
  project:
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    $ <b>cd <em>my-project</em></b>
    my-project$ <b>./bin/project-setup --instrumentation-filter my_filter</b>
  </pre><p>
  This will create a new <code>modules/my_filter</code> directory containing
  associated required files. Search for <code>USER-TODO</code> markers in
  the generated files for a description on what, and where, additional
  logic needs to be inserted.
  It can also be useful to take a look at the distributed source files
  of example filters, that are included in the package.
  </p><p>
  A filter must implement
  the <code>instrumentation_filter_master</code> interface and drive
  the <code>instrumentation_filter_slave</code> interface for the
  slaves it has been assigned. The slaves are
  <b>instrumentation_filter_aggregator</b> objects which
  are automatically created when a connection is created.
</p><p>
  When a filter object is created, it must first be assigned a
  session-unique "source-id". This can be retrieved from the
  python <b><i>instrumentation.get_filter_source</i></b> function. This
  can be achieved from the filter's <code>simics_start.py</code> file,
  which should contain a command for creating the filter.  Once the
  object has been created, the python code could inform its source-id
  to the filter by calling
  the <b><i>instrumentation_filter_master.set_source_id</i></b> function.
</p><p>
  The <b><i>instrumentation_filter_master.add/remove_slave</i></b> functions
  will be called when ever <b>&lt;tool&gt;.add-filter</b> is adding
  this tool, or when additional connections are added or removed
  from the tool.
  </p><p>
  Note that filters could be assigned slaves located in different
  cells (executing in different threads). It is up to the filter
  to handle this, for example by not supporting it, to avoid strange
  threading problems. This can be achieved by returning
  <code>false</code> in the <b><i>add_slave</i></b> method when the
  <i>provider_obj</i> is located in a different cell than
  previous slaves.
  </p><p>
  How a filter enables/disables the slaves is up to the filter.
  There are some scenarios:
  </p><p>
  </p><ul>
    <li>The filter itself listens to the corresponding provider
      as the slave's provider object, and only enable/disable
      the corresponding connection based on this.
      This would be safe from a threading point of view even if
      the providers are located in different cells.</li>
    <li>The filter gets stimuli from something else and enables
      or disables all slaves at the same time.</li>
    <li>A combination of the above. Known providers' connections
      are enabled/disabled when something happens on those.
      The "unknown" listeners can be all enabled/disabled
      when one or all providers are in a certain state.</li>
  </ul>  
<p>
  Figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex6">21</a> show how a filter reacts on a provider
  and only enables/disables the slave which is associated with the same
  provider.
  </p><div class="figure" id="api-ex6">

      <img alt="" src="api-ex6.png"><br>
      <div class="caption">Figure 21. Thread-safe filtering</div>
  </div></div>

<p>
  In figure <a class="reference" href="#api-ex7">22</a>, however, the filter tries to
  enable/disable connections in two different cells. This could
  potentially crash. If cross-cell filtering is needed, the connection
  in the other cell must be relayed through
  a <b><i>SIM_run_alone()</i></b> function, which will be delayed and
  invoked when it is safe to do cross-cell calls.

  <h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Provider-API">40.4 Provider API</a></h2>
<p>
    
</p><p>
  How the actual communication between a provider and tool should be
  achieved, must be designed case by case. The
  instrumentation framework itself, does not have any specific
  requirements on this. When a new provider interface needs to be
  designed, it is recommended to re-use design philosophies and naming
  schemes from already existing interfaces, keeping provider interfaces
  as consistent as possible.
  </p><p>
  In some way, the tool must inform the provider that it wants to
  get instrumentation information. Typically there are two designs for
  this:
  </p><ul>
    <li><b>Callback based</b>. The provider implements an interface
      which offers callback functions to be registered, one function
      per particular feature the provider provides. The callbacks
      are invoked by the provider when something interesting
      happens in the provider.</li>
    <li><b>Interface based</b>. The provider implements a simple
      interface which can register connection objects. The
      provider could then detect which interfaces that exists in the
      tool connection and based of this, later invoke corresponding
      interface calls towards the tool connection's interfaces.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Two generic interfaces can be implemented in the provider (when found
  useful):
  </p><ul>
    <li>The <b>instrumentation_order</b> interface,
      which allows the user to change the dispatch order for
      registered tool connections with the
      generic <b>instrumentation-order</b>
      and <b>instrumentation-move</b> commands.</li>
    <li>A callback based provider can implement the <b>callback_info</b>
      interface, which allows the generic
      <b>list-instrumentation-callbacks</b> command to list callbacks that
      has been installed in the provider.</li>
  </ul>
  These interfaces are located in
  the <code>simics/model-iface/instrumentation-provider.h</code>
  header file.
  <p>
  </p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="CPU-Instrumentation-API">40.4.1 CPU Instrumentation API</a></h3>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  Simics CPU instrumentation is provided on top of the generic
  instrumentation framework, where the processor model acts as a
  instrumentation provider.
  This chapter describes Simics' processor instrumentation API.
</p><p>
  A tool that wants to connect to the CPU instrumentation and
  use the <b><i>instrumentation.make_tool_commands</i></b> function
  must set the <i>provider_requirements</i> argument
  to <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code>, and maybe more interfaces.
</p><p>
  The <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface is the
  main interface used, but there are also other interfaces
  that must be used in certain circumstances as a consequence
  of some of the callbacks.
  Figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex1">23</a> shows some of the interfaces
  that are used.
</p><p>
  </p><div class="figure" id="cpu-api-ex1">

      <img alt="" src="cpu-api-ex1.png">
      <br>
      <div class="caption">Figure 23. CPU instrumentation interfaces</div>
  </div></div>

<p>
  A processor does not require any
  implemented interfaces from a tool, instead a tool will
  subscribe for information from a processor and register function
  callbacks which are invoked when the subscribed
  feature is triggered on a processor.
</p><p>
  The interface can be used in two different ways:
  </p><ul>
    <li>
      The instrumentation framework, where the supplied connection
      object acts as a container for all registered callbacks. This
      allows all callbacks to be moved in dispatch order, compared to
      other connections. It also makes it easier to control multiple
      callbacks since it it possible to disable, enable and remove all
      callbacks associated with a connection with one method call.
    </li>
    <li>
      Or as simple callbacks, which is achieved by
      specifying <code>NULL</code> or <code>None</code>, in C or Python respectively,
      as connection pointer. This allows the interface to be used from
      a Python script, without the need to create Simics connection
      objects. With this setup, the user must control each callback
      by itself. When invoked, these callbacks will be called prior
      to the connection grouped callbacks, which also allows the processor
      model itself to be extended using the same interface.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  The interfaces used for the CPU instrumentation are located in
  the <code>simics/model-iface/cpu-instrumentation.h</code>
  header file. The architecture specific interfaces are located
  in <code>simics/arch/x86-instrumentation.h</code>, etc.
  </p><p>
  Subscribing to CPU instrumentation can be global (all instructions
  and/or memory accesses) or more carefully selected for each
  instruction at a time by the tool.
</p><p>
  For example, assume a tool wants to monitor when certain
  instructions are executed. This can be done in different ways, each
  with pros and cons. The following list tries to highlight the workings
  of these different ways.
  </p><dl><dt id="dt:with-global-instrumentation"><b>With global instrumentation</b></dt><dd>By registering a callback with
      the <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface using
      the <b><i>register_instruction_before_cb()</i></b> method, the tool
      will get a callback for each instruction executed.  If the tool
      is only looking for certain types of instructions, it would need
      to use the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code>
      interface's <b><i>get_instruction_bytes()</i></b> method and filter
      out the unwanted instructions. This will become very
      slow. See figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex2a">24</a>.
      <div class="figure" id="cpu-api-ex2a">
<div style="text-align: center">  
	  <img alt="" src="cpu-api-ex2a.png">
	  <br>
	  <div class="caption">Figure 24. Using instruction callbacks</div>
      </div></div>

      <p>
    </p></dd><dt id="dt:with-selective-instrumentation"><b>With selective instrumentation</b></dt><dd>The tool can filter out which instructions it wants to get a
      callback from more selectively. This is done by
      registering a callback with
      the <code>cpu_instrumentation_subscribe</code> interface using
      the <b><i>register_cached_instruction_cb()</i></b> method.  The
      tool will now be called when each instruction is about to be
      cached in the CPU model's internal instruction cache (this is
      a Simics internal cache and
      not the same as the cache found on a real processor).
      <p>
      Just as before, the tools must decode what instruction that
      is about to be executed using
      the <code>cpu_instruction_query</code>
      interface's <b><i>get_instruction_bytes()</i></b> method. For the
      interesting instructions the tool can now register a dedicated
      callback using the
      <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code>
      interface's <b><i>register_instruction_before_cb()</i></b> method.
      Each cached instruction callback also carries a user-data
      pointer, which can be used by the callback. This means that the
      analysis is performed only once.  There are, however, multiple
      reasons why this internal cache may be flushed, if that happens
      the instruction must be re-decoded.
</p><p>
      Using the <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface is
      much faster than filtering for an instruction of interest
      each time it is executed, since the callback will only be called
      for the requested instructions. See figure <a class="reference" href="#cpu-api-ex2b">25</a>.
</p><p>
      </p><div class="figure" id="cpu-api-ex2b">

      </div></div>
      
    </dd><dt id="dt:with-a-counter"><b>With a counter</b></dt><dd>This is if the tool only wants to count how
      many times certain instructions are
      executed. The <code>cpu_cached_instruction</code> interface
      with the <b><i>add_counter</i></b> method, supports the fastest way
      to count instructions. Adding a pointer to a 64-bit
      counter for specific instruction means that the counter will
      increment each time this particular instruction is executed.
      This has very low overhead.
