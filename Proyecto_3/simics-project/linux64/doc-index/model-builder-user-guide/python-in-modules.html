<p>

</p><p>
Most Simics modules contain some code written in Python. The most
common uses of Python are to extend Simics with new CLI commands, as
discussed in chapter <a class="reference" href="new-commands.html">13</a>, and to write
component modules, as discussed in chapter <a class="reference" href="device-modeling-overview.html#component-creation">4.4</a>.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Python and Simics use conflicting nomenclature around the module
concept. A <em>Python module</em> is a single Python file, and
a <em>Python package</em> is a directory that contains multiple
related Python modules. A <em>Simics module</em> can contain multiple
Python files; thereby, it roughly corresponds to a Python package. Furthermore,
a Python package should not be confused with a <em>Simics add-on package</em>.
</div>Python code is added to a Simics module by adding filenames to
the <code><a name="PYTHON_FILES">PYTHON_FILES</a></code> variable in the
module's <code>Makefile</code>. The listed files are compiled
into <code>.pyc</code> files, placed in the directory
<code></code><em>[host]</em><code>/lib/python/simmod/</code><em>simics_module_name</em><code></code>,
where <em>simics_module_name</em> is the name of the Simics module, with
hyphens replaced with underscores. The <code>.pyc</code> files are
then available as submodules of
the <code><a name="simmod">simmod</a>.</code><em>simics_module_name</em><code></code> Python
package. As an example, consider a Simics module
named <code>my-module</code>, which contains the following in
its <code>Makefile</code>:
<pre class="jdocu_small">  PYTHON_FILES = common.py module_load.py simics_start.py
</pre><p>
The Python module defined by common.py can then be imported from
Simics as follows:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  import simmod.my_module.common
</pre><p>
Two filenames in <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> have special meaning:
</p><ul>
  <li>A file named <code><a name="simics_start.py">simics_start.py</a></code> will be automatically
    loaded when Simics starts.</li>
  <li>A file named <code><a name="module_load.py">module_load.py</a></code> will be automatically
    loaded when the Simics module is loaded.</li>
</ul>
In addition, the filename <code>checkpoint_update.py</code> is reserved
for future use, and not permitted.
<p>
It is possible to create a nested directory structure in
<code>PYTHON_FILES</code>. This works as in standard Python; i.e., each
subdirectory must contain a file <code>__init__.py</code>. Thus, the
following will create a subpackage <code>sub</code> with a
submodule <code>common</code>:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  PYTHON_FILES = sub/__init__.py sub/common.py
</pre><p>
The Python module <code>sub/common.py</code> can then be imported as
follows:</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  import simmod.my_module.sub.common
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Module tests that are written in Python should <em>not</em> be
included in the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable; the test framework
automatically finds and runs tests directly under the module's source
directory.</div><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Python-in-older-versions-of-Simics">12.1 Python in older versions of Simics</a></h2>
<p>Before the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable was supported,
there were two different mechanisms for using Python in modules. Both
mechanisms are deprecated, and will be removed in future Simics
versions. They are briefly explained here because they may appear in
existing source code:
</p><ul>
  <li>If files named <code><a name="gcommands.py">gcommands.py</a></code>
    and <code><a name="commands.py">commands.py</a></code> are found in the same
    directory as the module's <code>Makefile</code>, then they are run
    when Simics is started and when the module is loaded,
    respectively. This mechanism is only supported for modules with
    <code>SIMICS_API</code> set to 4.8 or older.</li>
  <li>If Python files are listed in the <code>SRC_FILES</code> variable,
    one Simics module is created for each such source file; module
    metadata is declared using Python comments on certain forms. It is
    an error to both specify <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> and list Python
    files in <code>SRC_FILES</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>

</p><p>
When a Python module imports another Python module in the same
Simics module, the recommended practice is to use
an <em>explicit relative import</em>:</p><pre class="jdocu_small">from . import common
from .common import utility
</pre><p>
    or, alternatively, to use the more verbose <em>absolute import</em>:</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import simmod.my_module.common
from simmod.my_module.common import utility
</pre><p>
Python permits a third variant of imports, called <em>implicit
relative imports</em>, which should be avoided in this case:</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import common   # BAD!
</pre><p>
This notation is bad because an implicit relative import can
easily be mistaken for an absolute import. Implicit relative
imports have been removed in recent versions of the Python language.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="python-in-modules-style-sharing">12.2.2 Sharing Python code between Simics modules</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
There are two ways to share Python code between modules. In most
cases, the best way is to list the shared file in
the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> variable of all modules. Use the
<code>EXTRA_MODULE_VPATH</code> variable (see <a class="reference" href="build-environment.html#makefile-details">3.5.3</a>) to make sure the file is found by Make. One copy of the
shared Python file will be created in each Simics module using it, and
each copy will act as an independent Python module in Simics.
</p><p>
Alternatively, a single instance of a Python module can be shared
between multiple Simics modules using absolute imports. While this
approach may appear simpler, it is also risky, because it places
very high compatibility requirements on the ABI exposed by the shared
module. Using an absolute import to access shared code from a
different module is therefore discouraged in general, and should only
be done if you fully understand the consequences. The following
example demonstrates how a seemingly innocent change can cause
compatibility problems:
</p><p>
Let's say that a configuration attribute is added in a new version of
a model A, and that a CLI command defined in shared code reads from
this attribute. Furthermore, let's say that the shared code is also
used by a model B, distributed in a different Simics add-on package,
and that the shared code is distributed in both packages. Now, suppose
that we use an <em>old</em> version of package A, where the new
attribute has not been added, together with a <em>new</em> version of
package B, where the attribute has been added. Simics will pick the
version of the shared code from B for both modules; this means that
the CLI command defined by the shared code will try to access a
nonexisting attribute, causing unintended errors.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Side-effects-in-modules">12.2.3 Side-effects in modules</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
It is generally considered good design to avoid side-effects when
merely importing a Python module. In Simics,
the <code>module_load</code> and <code>simics_start</code> modules
must have side-effects, usually in the form of class or command
registration, in order to be meaningful. However, for large Simics
modules it is recommended to keep these files small, and keep most
implementation in other Python files. For example, let's say a module
defines <b>info</b> and <b>status</b> commands for the three
devices <b>my-uart</b>, <b>my-pic</b>
and <b>my-timer</b>. Then it can make sense to define command
callbacks in a separate file, say <code>command_defs.py</code>:</p><pre class="jdocu_small">def uart_status(obj): <i>[…]</i> def uart_info(obj): <i>[…]</i> def
pic_status(obj): <i>[…]</i> def pic_info(obj): <i>[…]</i> def
timer_status(obj): <i>[…]</i> def timer_info(obj): <i>[…]</i>

  def register_commands(prefix):
      cli.register_status_command(prefix + 'uart', uart_status)
      cli.register_info_command(prefix + 'uart', uart_info)
      cli.register_status_command(prefix + 'pic', pic_status)
      cli.register_info_command(prefix + 'pic', pic_info)
      cli.register_status_command(prefix + 'timer', timer_status)
      cli.register_info_command(prefix + 'timer', timer_info)
</pre><p>
Now <code>module_load.py</code> can be implemented as follows:</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  from . import command_defs
  command_defs.register_commands('my-')
</pre><p>
One advantage of this approach is code reuse: If another Simics
module <code>your-module</code> contains models of similar hardware,
say <b>your-uart</b>, <b>your-pic</b>
and <b>your-timer</b>, then the <code>command_defs.py</code>
file can be shared between the Simics modules. After editing
the <code>PYTHON_FILES</code> and <code>EXTRA_MODULE_VPATH</code>
variables in the <code>Makefile</code> of <code>your-module</code>, as
discussed in section <a class="reference" href="#python-in-modules-style-sharing">12.2.2</a>,
<code>module_load.py</code> can be implemented just like
in <code>my-module</code>:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  from . import command_defs
  command_defs.register_commands('your-')
</pre><p>
Note that the <b><i>register_commands</i></b> function may have to be
parameterized differently, depending on how the <b>your-</b>
and <b>my-</b> models differ.
