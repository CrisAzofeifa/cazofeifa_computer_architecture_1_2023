<p>

</p><p>
Simics provides support to cooperate with other applications, either by linking
Simics in the other application, or by making the other application a part of
Simics.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Linking-Simics-into-Another-Application">46.1 Linking Simics into Another Application</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics has been built so it can be embedded into another application: it
consists in a small <code>simics</code> binary and several libraries, such as
<code>libsimics-common</code>, which contains the core functionality. The main
binary can be replaced so that, by integrating the Simics libraries, all Simics
functionality can be included as a part of another application.
</p><p>
The Simics Base package contains the source code of a Simics binary replacement
located in <code>src/misc/simple-simics/</code>. The following files are
included:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:makefile-linux"><b><code>Makefile.linux</code></b></dt><dd>Skeleton makefile showing how to build
the example on a Linux system.</dd><dt id="dt:makefile-mingw"><b><code>Makefile.mingw</code></b></dt><dd>Skeleton makefile showing how to build
the example on Windows with the MinGW compiler.</dd><dt id="dt:simple-simics-c"><b><code>simple-simics.c</code></b></dt><dd>Code linking in the Simics libraries
to provide the full simulation functionality.</dd></dl><p>The <code>simple-simics</code> illustrates the main steps to integrated Simics:
</p><p>
</p><ol>

<li>Call <b><i>SIM_init_environment()</i></b>.</li>

<li>Create a list of <code>init_arg_t</code> structures, filling it with
initialization arguments and their values. Make sure the last entry has NULL
fields. The structure is described in the <em>API Reference Manual</em>.
</li>

<li>Call <b><i>SIM_init_simulator2()</i></b> with the list as parameter.</li>

</ol>
<p>
Once there, there are two ways of controlling the simulation. 
</p><p>
Simics can run its own main loop, which can be done by
calling <b><i>SIM_init_command_line()</i></b> followed
by <b><i>SIM_main_loop()</i></b>. Once this is done, Simics will not return
control to the caller, so other means of communication must be put into place
if the calling application needs to react to simulation events. For example, a
dedicated Simics extension might be taking over.
</p><p>
Simics can also accept commands one at a time,
with <b><i>SIM_run_command()</i></b>. In that case, the interface stays in
control of the calling application.
</p><p>
There are a few caveats that needs to be taken into account when embedding
Simics:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>The paths that contain Simics libraries and their dependencies must be in
the search path for libraries. This is usually done in the Simics start
scripts, so when embedding Simics, the controlling application has to make the
necessary configuration changes itself:
<p>
</p><ul><li>On Linux, this concerns <code>[simics]/</code><em>host</em><code>/bin</code> (the
Simics libraries) and <code>[simics]/</code><em>host</em><code>/sys/lib</code> (system
dependencies provided along with Simics).</li>

<li>On Windows, all libraries and dependencies are
in <code>[simics]\win64\bin</code>.</li></ul></li>

<li>Even when embedded, Simics uses the standard and error outputs for its
messages, which might interfere with the controlling application's output.</li>

<li>When starting the simulation via <b><i>SIM_run_command()</i></b>, Simics
does not return control to the application until the simulation is somehow
stopped. This makes it important, if not indispensable, to place appropriate
callbacks in the simulation to keep control of what is going on. Callbacks can
be placed in real-time, via <b><i>SIM_realtime_event()</i></b>, or directly in the
simulation using haps and events.</li>

</ul>
<p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Integrating-Another-Application-into-Simics">46.2 Integrating Another Application into Simics</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
To integrate another application into Simics you need to be able to
build the application as a Simics module or at least as a shared
library you can load from a Simics module. If this is not possible see
chapter <a class="reference" href="external-world.html">44</a> for how to connect your
application to Simics.
</p><p>
The communication between Simics and the application needs to use the
Simics APIs. The exact nature of the communication depends on what the
embedded application does.
</p><p>
If your application runs its own simulation which needs to be
integrated with the Simics simulation you should use the Simics Device
API and the Model-to-Model and Model-to-Simulator interfaces to
integrate with Simics. This basically makes the module containing the
application a normal model module, as described in the <em>Model
Builder User's Guide</em>.
</p><p>
If the application simulates one or more processors which you want to
appear as processors in the Simics simulation use the Processor API,
documented in the <em>Processor Model Integration Guide</em>, instead.
</p><p>
Your application can also integrate with Simics as an extension module
using the Simulator API and Simulator-to-Simulator interfaces as
described earlier in this document.
</p><p>
Of course, these categories of applications are not rigid. An
application may need to use parts of the Simulator API to do its work,
for example it may need to use <b><i>SIM_register_work</i></b>
or <b><i>SIM_thread_safe_callback</i></b> even though it is mostly a
model.
