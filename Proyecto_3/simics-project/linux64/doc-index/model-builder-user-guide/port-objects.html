<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="port-objects">34 Port Objects</a></h1>
<p>

</p><p>
In Simics 6 there is a concept called Port Objects. A port object is a
child object which is created automatically together with its parent object.
The underlying idea is that a class should be able to specify a set of
child objects, denoted port objects, which will be created automatically
when the class is instantiated. The end user of the class does not need to
explicitly create the port objects or even know about them.
</p><p>
Port objects are not intended as a replacement for components, but rather
as a way to allow functionality to be factored out and put in separate
objects residing in the namespace below the object. As the name implies,
however, port objects are intended to function as a replacement for
port interfaces.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Registering-Port-Objects">34.1 Registering Port Objects</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Below is an example of how a port object can be registered on a class:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>// Define a signal reset function</b>
static void
signal_raise_reset(conf_object_t *port_obj)
{
        conf_object_t *parent_obj = SIM_port_object_parent(port_obj);
        ...
}

<b>// Create the class "myclass"</b>
cls = SIM_create_class("myclass", &amp;class_info);

<b>// Register the port port.RESET</b>
port_cls = SIM_register_simple_port(
        cls, "port.RESET", "Hardware Reset Port");

<b>// Register an interface on the created port object class</b>
static const signal_interface_t signal_iface = {
        .signal_raise = signal_raise_reset,
};
SIM_REGISTER_INTERFACE(port_cls, signal, &amp;signal_iface);
</pre><p>
</p><p>
In the example above, a port object is registered on <b>myclass</b>
with the name <b>port.RESET</b>. When the class
subsequently is instantiated as an object <b>myobj</b>, then the port
object will be created as <b>myobj.port.RESET</b>. The port object
will be an instance of the class <b>myclass.RESET</b> with
a single interface registered on this class in this case. The port object
class can be more complex than in the simple example above; it can be
defined to have attributes, multiple interfaces or even port objects
of its own.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Hierarchical-Class-Names">34.2 Hierarchical Class Names</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The preceding example defined a class with a hierarchical class name,
<b>myclass.RESET</b>. The dot in the class name has
the following meaning:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    When Simics tries to find the module
    defining <b>myclass.RESET</b> it will look for the module
    defining the class <b>myclass</b>,
    and <b>myclass.RESET</b> does not need to be listed in the
    Makefile for this module.
  </li>
  <li>
    There might be non-public interfaces between <b>myclass.RESET</b>
    and <b>myclass</b>. That is, it is assumed that the
    port object may have direct access to the instance data for
    <b>myclass</b> objects.
  </li>
</ul>      

<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-Existing-Classes-as-Port-Objects">34.3 Using Existing Classes as Port Objects</a></h2>
<p>

It is possible to use pre-defined classes as well when port objects
are defined, which is illustrated in the following example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>// Create the class "mydev"</b>
cls = SIM_create_class("mydev", &amp;class_methods);

<b>// Register the port object 'bus_clock' as a 'cycle-counter' class</b>
conf_class_t *cycle_counter_cls = SIM_get_class("cycle-counter");
SIM_register_port(cls, "bus_clock", cycle_counter_cls,
                  "Clock running at bus frequency");
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When <b>mydev</b> is instantiated, then a <b>cycle-counter</b>
instance will be created as <b>mydev.bus_clock</b>.
The <b>cycle-counter</b> class, which is included in the Simics Base
package, provides a cycle counter that runs at some user-defined frequency and
allows for event posting. In this example, the counter would typically be
used by <b>mydev</b> to model functionality that depends on some
device specific frequency.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Setting-Port-Object-State">34.4 Setting Port Object State</a></h2>
<p>

For port objects that have attributes, it is often useful for the
parent object to provide default values for certain attributes.
Below are some examples when this is particularly useful:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    The port object has a required attribute which takes an object,
    and this object should be the port object parent itself or
    some other object the parent knows about.
  </li>
  <li>
    The port object class needs certain parameters to be
    set in a specific way. One example could be a clock running
    at a frequency defined by the parent.
  </li>
</ul>      
<p>
The <b><i>SIM_set_attribute_default</i></b> function provides a way
for the port object parent to set default values. These default values
take effect only if the attribute in question is not set explicitly
when the object is created. Default attributes values can only
be set from the <b><i>init</i></b> method or from attribute
setters of objects under construction. The later allows state
to be propagated from a port object parent to its children.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Setting attribute values directly during object construction,
  rather than setting attribute defaults, will invariably break checkpointing
  or not have the intended effect. 
</div>Below is an example showing an <b><i>init</i></b> method which
sets a default value for the frequency attribute of its <b>bus_clock</b>
port object.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">static lang_void *
init(conf_object_t *obj)
{
    <b>// Configure the bus_clock frequency...</b>
    conf_object_t *clock = SIM_object_descendant(obj, "bus_clock");
    attr_value_t freq = SIM_make_attr_floating(1E6);
    SIM_set_attribute_default(clock, "frequency", freq);

    <b>// Do other initialization as needed...</b>
    return obj;
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The following is another example, where a bus object is propagated from
the attribute setter of the parent to a port object child.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">static set_error_t
attr_set_bus(conf_object_t *obj, attr_value_t *val)
{
    <b>// Propagate our configured bus as an</b>
    <b>// attribute default for the "device" port object</b>
    if (!SIM_object_is_configured(obj)) {
        conf_object_t *dev = SIM_object_descendant(obj, "device");
        SIM_set_attribute_default(dev, "bus", *val);
    }
    <b>// Do other things here...</b>
    return Sim_Set_Ok;
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
As a rule of thumb, it should be possible to instantiate a class
without having to explicitly set attributes for any of its registered port
objects.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Pre-Conf-Object-Support">34.5 Pre Conf Object Support</a></h2>
<p>

The port object support extends to the <b>pre_conf_object</b>,
as is illustrated in the following example, which uses the 'myclass'
Simics class defined previously:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; @myobj = pre_conf_object('myclass', 'myclass')
simics&gt; @print(myobj.port.RESET)
pre conf object myclass.port.RESET of type myclass.RESET
</pre><p>
That is, if a class defines port objects, then pre objects corresponding
to the port objects will be created automatically.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Port-Object-Parent">34.6 Port Object Parent</a></h2>
<p>

A special function <b><i>SIM_port_object_parent</i></b> exists to
retrieve the port object parent from a port object. The function
returns <code>NULL</code> if the object is not a port object.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Use <b><i>SIM_port_object_parent</i></b> to retrieve the
port object parent instead of relying on <b><i>SIM_object_parent</i></b>.
The main reason for this is that the former will always return the correct
object, whereas the later will return the hierarchical parent, which
sometimes is not the desired object. As an example,
if <b><i>SIM_object_parent</i></b> is applied to the objects
<b>myobj.port.RESET</b>, <b>myobj.port.signal[2]</b> and
<b>myobj.bus_clock</b>, then the return value will be
<b>myobj.port</b>, <b>myobj.port.signal</b> and <b>myobj</b>
respectively. The <b><i>SIM_port_object_parent</i></b> function, on the other
hand, consistently returns the wanted <b>myobj</b> object
in all three cases.
