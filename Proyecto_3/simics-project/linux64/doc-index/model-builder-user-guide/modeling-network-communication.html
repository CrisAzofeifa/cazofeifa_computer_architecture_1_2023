Simics provides <em>link</em> objects that model common network protocols such
as Ethernet (<b>ethernet-switch</b>, etc.) or serial networks
(<b>ser-link</b>). These are documented respectively in
the <em>Ethernet Networking Technology Guide</em> and a section of
the <em>Simics User's Guide</em>.
</p><p>
In addition, Simics makes available the necessary infrastructure to build
custom network simulation links while enjoying the same benefits as the
standard Simics links. How to best build custom network simulation is dependent
on the intended usage:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>Communication between devices does not require links at all: simple
interface calls between objects suffice. For easier configuration, a common
broadcast bus object can redistribute the messages on behalf of the sender,
with possibly more complex addressing schemes. All of this can be achieved with
a proper combination of Simics interfaces, and is no different than an
interrupt controller sending "messages" to the processor. 
<p>
It is important to note however, that this type of network simulation is
quickly constrained by the fact that it can not be multithreaded, so it will
limit the possibilities of simulating large systems. There are cases where this
does not matter—or at least, does not matter enough yet—such as for
the standard Simics <b>i2c-link</b>, which uses a similar scheme as
described above.</p></li>

<li>For multithreaded communication between devices, Simics link objects are a
requirement. However, there are simple cases that can be covered with an
existing link:
the <b>datagram_link</b>. The <b>datagram_link</b> is a simple,
yet fully functional broadcast link that transmit simple byte string messages
from one sender to all the other devices on the link. It is meant primarily as
an example of a custom link, but it can be reused directly for simple
point-to-point communication between two devices, or a simple broadcast
communication. The <code>datagram_link</code> interface used for
communication is documented in the <em>API Reference Manual</em> while the
connector type used for components is described in section
<a class="reference" href="creating-configurations.html#cmp-connector-types">24.10</a>.</li>

<li>For more complex communication protocol, such as multiple message types
(link status, link speed, data transfer, etc.), more advanced addressing
schemes (unicast, multicast groups, etc) or different device roles on the link
(such as senders and receivers in the <b>signal-link</b>), a custom
link is more appropriate. The link library for custom links is described, along
with the link API, in the <em>Link Library Programming Guide</em>.</li>

</ul>
