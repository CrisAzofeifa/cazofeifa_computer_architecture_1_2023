<p>

</p><p>
This chapter provides some insights into various guidelines and
recommendations for how to build high quality models that integrate
and perform well in Simics. You may also refer to chapter 
<a class="reference" href="development-checklist.html">8</a> for further guidance.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Structuring-DML-Code">6.1 Structuring DML Code</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The intention of this chapter is to standardize how to write DML
devices. This includes how to structure the source code and naming DML
objects, DML files, and devices. The purpose is to learn how to
produce readable and maintainable code.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Device-Names">6.1.1 Device Names</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The DML device name must contain the modeled device identification
name. It is not recommended to name the device after the type of
device (such as "watchdog" or similar), as there can be more than one
device of that type in Simics.
</p><p>
The complete human-readable device name should be set using the
device's <a name="desc-parameter"></a><code>desc</code> parameter.
</p><p>
Example: a <i>TBD4711 watchdog</i> device should be named
<i>TBD4711</i> and its <code>desc</code> parameter should be set to
<code>"TBD4711 watchdog"</code>.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="File-Names">6.1.2 File Names</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Running the <code>project-setup</code> script will give you a DML
skeleton file and module directory with the same name as the device
and in general this pattern should be followed. Occasionally when
modeling a chip with distinct logical units which are not used
individually it is appropriate to model both devices in one module
directory, see section <a class="reference" href="advanced-programming-with-dml.html#dividing-device">9.5</a> for
guidelines. The other case where deviation from standard naming is
appropriate is when the device name is overly long. In these cases the
following rules should be followed:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>The full name should be used when naming the module directory</li>
<li>If the full name is too long name the DML file after a distinct
shortened version, or the type of device. Example; a DML file for
a <i>TBD4711 watchdog with blinking lights</i> device should be
named <code>TBD4711.dml</code> or <code>watchdog.dml</code>.</li>
<li>When modeling a chip with multiple distinct logical units, name the
module directory after the chip and name the DML files after the
logical units. Example; a <i>watchdog</i> unit in the <i>BAR17</i> SoC should
be named <code>BAR17_watchdog.dml</code> or
<code>watchdog.dml</code>.</li>
<li>Try to avoid using company names, or long device specific version
numbers. Be sure to include this information in the Device Name
or <code>desc</code> parameter</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Bank-Names">6.1.3 Bank Names</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Descriptive bank names are vital to make the DML code easy to
read. Bank names are also used when mapping regions in
memory spaces.
</p><p>
This is the priority list when naming a bank:
</p><ol>

<li>Registers are often documented in groups in the Programmer's
Reference Manual for a device. It is best to use the group name from
the manual when implementing a device from a user manual.</li>

<li>Name the bank after the logical unit type, if the registers are not
grouped, or the device is a logical unit in a SoC.</li>

<li>The last alternative is to name the bank <i>regs</i> to highlight
that the bank contains common registers.</li>

</ol>
<p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Register-Fields">6.1.4 Register Fields</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The register field definitions can be written in several ways. Here
are some examples of recommended ways to define fields.
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">register a size 4 @ 0x0 {
    field Enable   [0:0];
    field Disable  [4:1];
    field Trigger [31:11];
}
register b size 4 @ 0x4 {
    field Enable  [0];
    field Disable [4:1];
    field Trigger [31:11];
}
register c size 4 @ 0x8 {
    field Trigger [31:11];
    field Disable [4:1];
    field Enable  [0];
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
The field order should always comply with the device documentation. It
is otherwise hard to compare code and documentation.
</p><p>
It is often better to use <code>@ [0:0]</code> when there are several
multi-bit fields in the device. But it is better to use <code>@ [0]</code> in a
register with only single-bit fields.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Structuring-DML-Files">6.1.5 Structuring DML Files</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
This section proposes a DML file structure that makes DML code easy to
read.  Keep in mind that you have to adapt these recommendations for
your own devices.
</p><p>
The recommended order is:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:file-description"><b><em>file description</em></b></dt><dd>A DML file should always begin with a
short description of the file in a comment.

<pre class="jdocu_small">// sample-dma-device.dml - sample DML code for a Simics DMA device. In this
// case used to illustrate how to structure DML code.
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p></dd><dt id="dt:version-declaration"><b><em>version declaration</em></b></dt><dd>The version declaration is
required. It defines the DML version this file is written for. A device can
consist of DML files written for different DML versions.

    + "DMA completion.";
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p></dd><dt id="dt:header"><b><i>header</i></b></dt><dd>Add C code to the beginning of

bank declarations early in the file is to help code readers to get a
quick overview of the device.  The declaration of a bank should only
contain basic declarations of its registers, by defining their names, offsets,
description strings and templates. It is usually recommended to place
each bank in a separate DML file, but if a device contains smaller banks
that are tightly coupled, it can be better to place them in the same DML file.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Object-Members-and-Scope">6.1.6 Object Members and Scope</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
DML allows you to group methods and data together with DML
objects. Here is an example:

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">attribute fifo {
    parameter type = "[i*]";
    data uint8 vals[$MAX_VALS];
    <i>[â€¦]</i>

    method pop() -&gt; (uint8 val) {
        <i>[â€¦]</i>
    }

    method push(uint8 val) {
        <i>[â€¦]</i>
    }
}
<i>[â€¦]</i>
call $fifo.push(17);
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
The <b><i>pop()</i></b> and <b><i>push()</i></b> methods and the <i>vals</i> data
are members of the <i>fifo</i> attribute. This makes the usage of FIFO
simpler and there is no confusion which method pops and which methods push data
on the FIFO, as it would if the methods where global.
</p><p>
Here is another very useful template for attributes to use when saving
<em>dbuffer</em> data:

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">template dbuffer_attribute {
    parameter type = "d|n";
    data dbuffer_t *buf;
    method set(attr_value_t val) {
        if ($buf)
            dbuffer_free($buf);
        if (SIM_attr_is_data(val)) {
            $buf = new_dbuffer();
            memcpy(dbuffer_append($buf, SIM_attr_data_size(val)),
                   SIM_attr_data(val), SIM_attr_data_size(val));
        } else {
            $buf = NULL;
        }
    }
    method get() -&gt; (attr_value_t val) {
        if (!$buf)
            val = SIM_make_attr_nil();
        else
            val = SIM_make_attr_data(dbuffer_len($buf),
                                     dbuffer_read_all($buf));
    }
}
<i>[â€¦]</i>
attribute frame {
    is dbuffer_attribute;
    parameter documentation = "An Ethernet frame.";
}
<i>[â€¦]</i>
inline $send_frame($frame.buf);
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="General-Usability">6.2 General Usability</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This chapter describes how to write device models that are easy to use
and the generic rules on how to write device modules that comply with
the standard way of writing Simics modules.
</p><p>
The user interface of a Simics module consists of three parts: its
attributes, its interfaces, and the commands it adds to the Simics
command line interface. You should try to make the user interface of
your model similar in style to that of existing Simics models.
</p><p>
Every model should have an <b><a name="info">info</a></b> command, giving
static information about the device, and a
<b><a name="status">status</a></b> command, that gives dynamic information.
See chapter <a class="reference" href="new-commands.html#info-and-status-commands">13.7</a> for more
information.  Model Builder also includes a library for writing tests
to check that all devices in your modules have <b>info</b> and
<b>status</b> commands. See the <em>API Reference Manual</em>
for more information.
</p><p>
Look at the interfaces of similar devices to see what other commands
may be useful, and try to use the same names for similar commands and
parameters. Use existing API functionality where appropriate, rather
than inventing your own.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="checkpointing">6.2.1 Checkpointing</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="checkpoints"></a>

</p><p>
The ability to checkpoint and restore the state of a system is
crucial to Simics functionality. Your device model should support
checkpointing. In particular, you should ensure that:
</p><ul>
<li>All relevant state variables can be accessed as attributes</li>
<li>The device can have its entire relevant state restored by writing
    to those attributes</li>
<li>That an attribute can be written to any number of times while the
    device is active, and not assume that only a single
    initialization will be performed, to support the quick
    checkpoints of reverse execution.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As attribute setter functions for more complex attributes can be hard
to get right, be sure to read <a class="reference" href="device-modeling-overview.html#attribute_init">4.2.7.3</a>
<i>very</i> carefully.
</p><p>
Attributes containing configuration parameters that never change
during the lifetime of the device still need to accept setting their
values. But since they will only be set with the value they already
have, they only have to check that the value is unchanged and signal
an error if not.
</p><p>
Ensure that the internal state of the device model is consistent at
all times. If, for example, the model caches some information that
depends on attribute values, these caches need to be flushed when the
attribute is set. This is usually not a problem when restoring
checkpoints from disk, but when using micro checkpoints and reverse
execution it can easily cause trouble.
</p><p>
The checkpointing and reverse execution test libraries included with
Model Builder can be used to test for at least basic support for these
features.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Deterministic-Models">6.2.2 Deterministic Models</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics is deterministic and to keep the system deterministic all
device models must be deterministic.
</p><p>
The basic rule to make a model deterministic is to save all device
state data when writing checkpoints. The state is read from the
device via the device attributes. Several DML object types implicitly
corresponds to device attributes, examples are; attribute, register and
connect.
</p><p>
Take extra care when using the data declaration as it does not
implicitly correspond to an attribute.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Saving-Data">6.2.3 Saving Data</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
There are several ways to save device data. The best way to save the
data depends on how much data to save. A state with little data is
best saved by creating an attribute with an integer or floating-point
type or a small array:

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">attribute counter {
    parameter documentation = "Counting number of packets.";
    parameter allocate_type = "uint32";
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Saving larger blocks of unstructured data is best done by creating an
attribute with type set to data:

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">attribute buffer_attribute {
    parameter documentation = "Packet data.";
    parameter type = "d|n";
    <i>[â€¦]</i>
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><p>
Structured state can be saved in the form of lists, or list of lists
etc:

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">attribute structured_attribute {
    parameter documentation = "A string and two integers.";
    parameter type = "[sii]";
    <i>[â€¦]</i>
}

The best way to save a large amount of data is to use Simics images. Images are
optimized to only save differences between two consecutive checkpoints
and not all data in each checkpoint:

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import "simics/model-iface/image.dml";

connect data_image {
    parameter documentation = "Image holding data";
    parameter configuration = "required";
    interface image;
}

method save_data(uint64 address, const uint8 *buffer) {
    $data_image.image.write(
        cast(buffer, const void *),
        address,
        256);
}

<p>
<a name="inquiryaccess"></a>

</p><p>
As listed in the Simics Model Development Checklist - Device Checklist , DE-11;
device objects should handle inquiry accesses correctly. In Simics an 'inquiry
access' is defined as an access without any side effects beyond changing the
value of the register being accessed. Other domains call this 'debug
access'. When using DML this is automatically handled for registers where the
read_access and write_access methods have not been overridden. If overridden,
or access is handled at bank level or elsewhere, the model must add the
corresponding logic to handle inquiry accesses.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="errors">6.2.5 Error Reporting</a></h3>
<p>
<a name="errorreporting"></a>

</p><p>
The model should handle errors in a forgiving way.  Avoid crashing
or triggering assertions; instead, log an error message and try to
continue anyway.
</p><p>
There are three different kinds of errors that should be reported
by a Simics device:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><a name="erroroutside-architecture"></a><i>Outside architecture</i>
    error.  A part of the device whose behavior is not specified in
    the hardware documentation has been accessed.  For example, a
    reserved register has been written to.  Use
    <code>log spec_viol</code> for this kind of error.</li>

<li><a name="errorunimplemented"></a><i>Unimplemented</i> error.  A part
    of the device which has been left unimplemented in the model
    (abstracted away) was accessed.  This suggests a bug in the model,
    or that the model is used with software it was not developed for.
    Use <code>log unimpl</code> for this kind of error.
<p>
    <a name="approximation"></a> In some cases it is sufficient to give
    a warning for this kind of situation, for example if the model
    returns approximate or invented values.</p></li>

<li><a name="errorinternal"></a><i>Internal</i> error.  The internal
    state of the model implementation has been corrupted beyond
    repair.  Look for "this will never happen" comments and
    reconsider<i>â€¦</i>  Use <code>log error</code> for this kind of
    error.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Simics has extensive support for <a name="logging">logging</a>, allowing you to
assign the output to different message categories, and different
levels of verbosity. See the <em>DML Reference Manual</em> and the
<em>API Reference Manual</em> for details.  Logging is
mostly used during development and debugging of the model, but is also useful
to aid inspection of the device state during actual simulation.
</p><p>
Always use detailed error messages. Often, the error messages are
the only source of information when a bug is reported by another user.
It is not certain that the execution can be repeated, or that the developer
will have access to the same setup.
