This document shows how to model your hardware system in Simics and
how to extend Simics with new functionality. This document does not
stand alone. The Simics and DML reference manuals are invaluable for
the details. It is not intended to be read from start to finish. After
reading the introduction part feel free to read about the topics which
interest you.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
You need the Simics Model Builder product to develop models and
extensions for Simics.
</div>This document is divided into several parts:
<dl><dt id="dt:introduction-and-preparation"><b>Introduction and Preparation</b></dt><dd>This part contains an introduction to modeling virtual system and

</p><p>
The introduction chapter you are reading describes the concepts of
system modeling and how they map to modeling in Simics. It also
discusses the kind of information that must be gathered to model a
system. After reading it you should have a basic understanding of what
modeling is and what information about the hardware you need to
gather.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="What-is-a-Model">1.1 What is a Model?</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics provides a full systems simulation environment for CPUs,
boards, platforms, racks and even very complex heterogeneous systems
networked together. A model provides the software running on a virtual
platform within the Simics environment with a representation of the
hardware interface that is exposed to the software, i.e., a
"programmer's view". 
</p><p>
When creating models, it is important to choose the right level of
abstraction. A comparison can be made with the field of physics, where
different models are used for solving different types of problems. For
example, on the sub-atomic scale quantum mechanics is used, to compute
the motion of Earth-bound objects classical mechanics is used, and for
objects moving at high speed relativistic models are used. Choosing the
wrong model for a problem will either make it intractable or will not
provide enough detail to yield correct results. The same goes for
models of digital systems where a number of different abstraction
levels are typically used. As more details are added to the
simulation, the slower it will run and the more costly it will be to
develop. There exists a trade off between simulation speed and model
fidelity. Figure <a class="reference" href="#detail_vs_speed_figure">1</a> shows the
characteristics for some commonly used abstractions. Note that the
figure serves as an illustration and actual performance may vary
substantially even within a specific abstraction.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="What-is-a-Functional-Model">1.2 What is a Functional Model?</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
A Simics functional model presents the software with a functionally
accurate view into the virtualized hardware.  Functional models are
transaction based, applying a blackbox/transfer function approach
where it is not important to duplicate how a specific result is
obtained, but to duplicate what the exact transfer function will
result in.  For timing-critical sections (e.g., device drivers response
to interrupts, etc.), Simics provides the ability to insert delays
that can be fine-tuned to model not only what data is provided, but
also when that data is provided to the remainder of the system.
</p><p>
Using this approach, a functional model can be built based solely on
hardware design and interface documents combined with some knowledge
of the expectations and requirements of the operating system(s)
running on top of that hardware.  When building a functional model,
there is no need to have detailed knowledge on the inner workings of
the platform or device.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="What-is-a-Systems-Model">1.3 What is a Systems Model?</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Today’s systems consist of many components including multi-core CPUs,
multiple platforms, accelerators, racks, and heterogeneous
combinations of CPU, DSP, ASIC and FPGA all connected via standard
network, RapidIO, or backplane communication mechanisms.  Although
many simulation environments and the models which they run are
specific to a specific CPU core or maybe a System on Chip (SoC), these
solutions fail to support the complete system.  Simics support for
heterogeneous models and distributed host simulation processing
provides the ability to model very complex systems while retaining a
level of performance that is usable for real software development
tasks.
</p><p>
A Simics system model may consist of tens, hundreds or thousands of
smaller, independent models (CPU, platform, rack, etc.), any one of
which can be created by an independent engineer and/or in different
modeling languages. These smaller models, standing alone from a
functional perspective, are connected together using Simics component
system and scripting capability, or with one of Simics communications
network infrastructure models (TCP/IP, MIL-STD-1553, RapidIO, etc.) in
order to provide the full systems model and simulation.  This
sub-element independence and flexibility allows a full system model to
be created from disparate components and by leveraging in-house and
3rd party expertise.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Simics-Team">1.4 Simics Team</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
A typical customer’s Simics model team encompasses two key areas of
knowledge.
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li>Functional model knowledge – possessing the ability to translate a
  hardware block diagram and design documents into the DML language</li>

<li>Simics scripting and API knowledge – possessing the ability to
  connect smaller model components and devices as needed to form a
  larger system using Simics command API, Python or C/C++</li>
</ol>
<p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="The-Modeling-Process">1.5 The Modeling Process</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The processes when virtualizing a new system roughly follows this
outline:
</p><p>
</p><ol>

<li>Create a list of devices and processors that comprise the system
by collecting and reading design specifications, programmers reference
manuals, and other relevant documents.</li>

<li>Based on an analysis of the expected system usage, make a
preliminary decision on the necessary level of abstraction necessary
for each device. Can it be ignored, stubbed, or does it need
to be fully implemented? (e.g., does the RTOS use the MMU? If not,
don't model it.)</li>

<li>Reuse existing device models and processor
models from the Simics standard library. The library makes it faster to
produce an initial model, since models for many common standard parts
already exist. Reuse often means adapting an existing model of a
similar device, which is much faster then writing a new model from
scratch.</li>

<li>Create initial models of any remaining devices using the DML tool.
Initially, ignore as much functionality as possible to quickly get a
working basic model, but write tests for the parts you do implement to
make sure they behave as intended. This also helps catch errors which
may get introduced when you add more parts to the model.</li>

<li>Test the new system model with software that should run on the
model, and add (or stub out) any missing functionality or devices 
<em>required by the
software</em>. For new devices where no software exist yet, create
independent test cases.</li>

<li>Iterate until the model runs the requisite software.</li>

</ol>
<p>
This methodology is the classic iterative method, where you test the
model early and often in order to explore the precise
requirements. Historically, this had many names, from spiral model
to agile methods or test-driven development.
</p><p>
The goal is to obtain a model which runs the required software, but
which implements only the hardware functionality necessary to run the
software and exercise its interesting behaviors. Over time,
more functionality can be added to the model.
</p><p>
Often, it is possible to start using the new virtual system almost
immediately after the project start. Even a basic system that does not
yet contain all components can be used to begin software development. For
example, a boot loader typically requires less virtual hardware to be
in place than a full operating system port. Over time, more devices
will be added to the virtual system, and it will evolve towards the
final model.
</p><p>
With Simics's modular approach, it is always possible to go back and
improve any element of the model.

</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Transaction-Level-Device-Modeling">1.6.1 Transaction-Level Device Modeling</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
In Transaction-Level Device Modeling (TLM), each interaction with a device, typically, a processor reading
from or writing to the registers of the devices, is handled at once:
the device is presented with a request, computes the reply, and
returns it in a single function call. This is far more efficient and
easier to program than modeling the details of how bits and bytes are
moved across interconnects, cycle-by-cycle.
</p><p>
In general, immediate non-pipelined completion of an operation is
sufficient for modeling device's behavior. When the device driver
expects a delay, that delay must be modeled, however the specific
action or activity that leads to the delay does not need to be
modeled. A classic example is a device that uses a hardware interrupt
to signal command completion. The driver expects to be able to run
code to prepare for the interrupt after writing the command to the
device.  In a transactional model, the device model must include a
delay between the completion of the command and the interrupt
signaling the completion to the system. In this manner, the device
local effects of a transaction are computed immediately, but
notification of completion is deferred until the proper time has
elapsed. 
</p><p>
Transaction-level models are typically implemented using the DML tool.
DML provides a C-like programming language designed specifically for
this type of modeling. Although device models can be written directly
in C, using DML reduces development time and makes the code more
readable and maintainable, and reduces the risk of making errors.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Memory-System-Modeling-and-Address-Maps">1.6.2 Memory System Modeling and Address Maps</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The memory map is a fundamental service provided by the Simics
framework, and is a core component in enabling very fast
simulation. The address space of a processor is modeled by Simics as a
memory map. This approach allows the processor to directly access
memories and devices without involving any explicit models of
buses. This approach provides a functionally correct memory interface
to the software, since software is unaware of <em>how</em> the data
gets from the memory to the processor, and results in fast instruction
execution and data access. With this approach, Simics's core memory
handling is able to provide a virtual system with very fast read/write
access to RAM and read access to FLASH and ROM without the requirement
to involve any explicit device models.
</p><p>
Even when a Simics model includes a memory controller it is only used
to manipulate, initialize or control the underlying activity of the
Simics memory system and not as a component which is directly involved
in accessing memory.
</p><p>
Simics also provides <b>image</b> objects to manage data for
devices with large amounts of memory such as RAM, ROM, Flash, and
disks. Image features include lazy allocation of host memory so that
only data which is actually used is loaded. This allows Simics to
simulate target memories which are larger than the physical memory of
the host machine. Images also support incremental checkpoints of the
system state.
</p><p>
For the simulation of PCI and similar interfaces where there are
several levels of addressing being used, Simics uses subordinate
memory maps cascaded from the primary memory map. This makes it easy
to translate real-system mappings into the Simics system
configuration. This method allows PCI models in Simics to support
software probing and configuration, just like real PCI systems. The
software setup is reflected in the PCI memory map, and device accesses
are kept very efficient.
</p><p>
</p><div class="figure" id="mapping_figure">

<div style="text-align: center">

<div class="caption">Figure 3. Mapping example.</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>

The illustration in figure <a class="reference" href="#mapping_figure">3</a> shows a
simple example of how Simics uses memory spaces to map the processor's
memory range to its immediately connected memory and devices, as well
as across a PCI system to Ethernet and SCSI controllers. The PCI
bridge will configure the PCI memory map when the software configures
the PCI system, but will not be invoked in actual accesses to PCI
devices.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Processor-Modeling">1.6.3 Processor Modeling</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The DML tool has been developed to support high performance and high
level abstraction for all system devices with the exception of
processors. When running simulation with functional models of devices
the vast majority of host processing is used to simulate the target
processors. As a result processor models (sometimes referred to as
Instruction Set Simulators (ISS)) provided by Simics teams are highly
optimized and tightly integrated into Simics. The result is that, at
peak speeds, Simics can run billions of simulated instructions per
second.
</p><p>
In order to run all the software of a system, the processor must
implement both the user-level and supervisor-level interfaces of the
processors, as well as the memory-management unit and various
low-level machine registers. Anything that is readable or writable
from the software side has to be modeled. Simics provides a large
library of fast and functionally complete and correct processor models
for most common embedded and desktop architectures including PowerPC,
MIPS, ARM, SPARC, and x86.
</p><p>
For customers with pre-existing processor models or who desire to develop their
own processor models, Simics provides an API that supports the integration of
those models into the Simics framework. See the <em>Processor Model
Integration Guide</em> for details.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Reusing-SystemC-and-Other-Types-of-Models">1.6.4 Reusing SystemC and Other Types of Models</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Recall that a full system model in Simics is comprised of multiple,
smaller sub-models and that Simics provides concurrent support for
multiple modeling languages.  Thus, Simics provides developers with
the ability to run or
reuse models that were not specifically written for
Simics, such as <a name="SystemC">SystemC*</a> models, custom C/C++ models, etc. The
most general way to integrate such a model into a Simics simulation is to write
a wrapper for the other model to translate its APIs to the Simics
framework's C/C++ API.
</p><p>
This approach can be used for almost any type of model, including models
designed to run at similar abstraction levels as regular Simics models, or
other types of models such as physics or hardware description language (HDL)
models. If the abstraction level or APIs used by the foreign model is very
different from that of Simics, it may require advanced techniques to do such an
integration. Please contact your Simics provider to get more
information about options and next steps.
</p><p>
To enable the integration of unmodified SystemC models into a Simics
simulation, use the <i><a name="SystemC-Library">SystemC Library</a></i> add-on package. Consult
the <em>SystemC Library Programming Guide</em> for details. Please contact
your Simics provider to get access to the SystemC Library
package.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Simics-High-Level-Modeling-Approach">1.6.5 Simics High Level Modeling Approach</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics models take a functional approach to modeling where entire
transactions are handled in a single function.
</p><ul>
<li>Models should focus on the what instead of the how.</li>
<ul>
<li>Model details are optimized for the software that will run on
  those models. Details that are irrelevant to software execution do
  not need to be modeled.</li>
<li>Explicit pre-defined device states can be easily provided to the
  software.</li>
</ul>
<li>Models should be incrementally created to support different phases
  of the product development life cycle.</li>
<ul>
<li>Initial model provides just enough emulation in order for the
  firmware team to begin their efforts.</li>
</ul>
<li>Functional models can be quickly created and connected together
  like building blocks.</li>
<ul>
<li>The system configuration is separate from device models.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>


</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Preparing-for-System-Modeling">1.7 Preparing for System Modeling</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Before starting to build a system model, certain
information should be collected. Since obtaining documentation can
sometimes take time, it is a good idea to start looking for
documentation and information as early as possible in a modeling
project. Documents and information that Simics professionals have
found to be particularly useful are:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

  <li>The system documentation, including block diagrams, describing how
  the components of the system are connected.</li>

  <li>The Programmers Reference Manuals (PRMs) for each of the main chips,
  devices, or functional blocks. The PRM goes by many names, such as
  Programming Reference, User Reference Manual, Technical Reference Manual,
  User Manual, and Reference Manual.</li>

  <li>The source code of the software such as the BSP (Board Support Package),
  device drivers, firmware, and operating systems, 
  that manipulates the hardware, if it already exists.</li>

</ul>
<p>
Once you have a basic understanding of the system, you should
prioritize the list of components that need to be modeled. The
following approach works well for many projects:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

  <li>Identify the minimum set of components required to boot the
  software. Having built a functional core model, it is easy to
  incrementally add devices to the system. Note that the software
  may have to be reconfigured to use only part of a
  system. Alternatively identify an existing Simics reference board model
  that is similar enough to serve as a baseline.</li>

  <li>Identify the components where the most technical risk lie: both
  risk in developing the model as well as in the software that
  manipulates the component. This can be time risk or lack of
  documentation, i.e., anything that can lead to missing the project
  goals or deadlines.</li>

  <li>Try to identify the components that have no initial impact on your
  system, i.e., those that will not be manipulated or used by
  software. They can either be modeled by a dummy model or not modeled at
  all.</li>

  <li>Try to identify the memories in the systems that can be handled
  using Simics default memory modeling. This is done by reading the
  documentation and identifying RAM, ROM, and flash regions in the
  physical memory map.</li>

</ul>
