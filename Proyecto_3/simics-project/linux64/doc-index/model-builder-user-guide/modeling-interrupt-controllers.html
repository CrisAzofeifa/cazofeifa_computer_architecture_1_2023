<p>

</p><p>
An interrupt controller is the link between devices generating
interrupt signals and the processor. A common device typically has
one or more outbound interrupt signals. The signals are connected to
the interrupt controller which has an outbound interrupt signal to the
processor. The interrupt controller is programmed by the processor to
clear, enable, and disable interrupts.
</p><p>
The interrupt controller often have one or more <em>mask</em>,
<em>interrupt</em>, and <em>update</em> registers. They may be named
differently, but it is the most common set of registers. The processor
use these registers to control which interrupts that are forwarded to
the processor.
</p><p>
Interrupt signals in Simics are modeled using the
<code>signal</code> interface. The interface has a
<b><i>signal_raise</i></b> and a <b><i>signal_lower</i></b> function. A
device raise an interrupt using the <b><i>signal_raise</i></b> and lowers
the interrupt using the <b><i>signal_lower</i></b> function.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Edge-Triggered-and-Level-Triggered">17.1 Edge Triggered and Level Triggered</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Interrupts are either level triggered or edge triggered. Assume that
an interrupt controller has an outbound signal port connected to the
processor and that the signal is called <em>out</em>. A device that can
generate interrupts has an outbound interrupt port connected to the interrupt
controller; this interrupt signal is called <em>in</em>. The signals can
either be high or low.  The interrupt controller typically has a couple of
control registers, controlling which interrupts are masked and which are
not. A masked interrupt signal is not forwarded to the processor.
</p><p>
Assume that the device raises the <em>in</em> signal from low to high,
and that the signal is not masked by the interrupt controller.
The interrupt controller will then raise the <em>out</em> signal from
low to high, regardless of whether the signal is level or edge triggered.
The difference between level and edge triggering is only visible if the
<em>in</em> signal is raised while the interrupt is masked, i.e., disabled.
In this case, the <em>out</em> signal will not be changed, but when the
interrupt is unmasked later, i.e., the interrupt is enabled by the processor,
the <em>out</em> signal will go from low to high only if it is level
triggered. An edge triggered signal will only affect the signal on
signal flanks.
</p><p>
The <em>out</em> signal is lowered when the device lowers the
<em>in</em> signal from high to low. The <em>out</em> signal can also
be lowered by the processor by clearing the interrupt if the signal is
edge triggered. A signal which is level triggered is not lowered when
the interrupt is cleared in the interrupt controller. In some cases
the signal will go from high to low to high when clearing a level
triggered signal.
