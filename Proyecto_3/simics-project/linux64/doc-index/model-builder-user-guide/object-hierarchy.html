<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="Object-Hierarchy">33 Object Hierarchy</a></h1>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics objects are stored in an object hierarchy. The hierarchy
allows objects to be grouped logically, making it easier to navigate
complex configurations. The object hierarchy also serves a secondary
purpose: it allows child objects to provide functionality to parent objects.
</p><p>
Starting with Simics 6, objects can be created in the namespace of another
object almost without restrictions. In previous versions, the object
hierarchy was tightly coupled to the component concept.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Accessing-Objects">33.1 Accessing Objects</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Several API functions exist for querying the object hierarchy:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b><i>SIM_object_descendant</i></b> returns a specific descendant of
    an object.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><i>SIM_object_parent</i></b> returns the parent of an object.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><i>SIM_object_iterator</i></b> returns an iterator for all
    descendants of an object.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b><i>SIM_shallow_object_iterator</i></b> returns an iterator for all
    children of an object.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
In Python, the root of the object hierarchy is the <code>conf</code> namespace,
and child objects can be specified using the dot operator, as in the
example <code>conf.parent.child</code>. If a child object and an attribute
has the same name, then the child object has precedence. Object attributes
can be accessed unambiguously using the <code>attr</code> namespace,
e.g. <code>object.attr.attribute</code>.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Object-Creation">33.2 Object Creation</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics objects can be created in the namespace of a another object by
simply providing a hierarchical name. This is illustrated in the following
example which creates the objects <b>testbench</b>,
<b>testbench.ram</b> and <b>testbench.ram.image</b>.
</p><p>

 </p><pre class="jdocu_small">tb = pre_conf_object('testbench', 'namespace')
image = pre_conf_object('testbench.ram.image', 'image', size = 0x1000)
ram = pre_conf_object('testbench.ram', 'ram')
ram(image = image)

SIM_add_configuration([tb, image, ram], None)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
The <b>pre_conf_object</b> class also allows the configuration
to be built hierarchically, which is illustrated in the following example:
</p><p>

 </p><pre class="jdocu_small">tb2 = pre_conf_object('testbench2', 'namespace')
tb2.image = pre_conf_object('image', size = 0x1000)
tb2.image.ram = pre_conf_object('ram')
tb2.image.ram(image = tb2.image)

SIM_add_configuration([tb2], None)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
 
</p><p>
Hierarchical object names can also be passed directly to e.g.
<b><i>SIM_create_object</i></b>:
</p><p>

 </p><pre class="jdocu_small">SIM_create_object("memory-space", "testbench.pspace", [])
</pre><p>
</p><p>
 
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Special-Object-Classes">33.3 Special Object Classes</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
There are two basic Simics classes which often are useful when building
the object hierarchy. The first one is the <b>namespace</b>
class which basically is an "empty" Simics class without any custom
attributes or interfaces. The second class is the <b>index-map</b>
class, which is used by Simics to represent object maps.
</p><p>
As an example, the objects <b>alpha[0]</b>, <b>alpha[1]</b>
and <b>alpha[2]</b> are children of the object <b>index-map</b>
object <b>alpha</b>. Nested index maps are used to construct
multi-dimensional object maps, e.g. <b>beta[1][2][3]</b>.
</p><p>
Simics adds index-maps automatically during object creation when
necessary, but sometimes it is useful to create the index map object
explicitly, like in the example below:
</p><p>

 </p><pre class="jdocu_small">array = pre_conf_object('array', 'index-map')
array[0] = pre_conf_object('memory-space')
array[1] = pre_conf_object('memory-space')

SIM_add_configuration([array], None)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
 
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Naming-Conventions">33.4 Naming Conventions</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics does not impose any rules how child objects should be named.
It is, however, recommended that the following conventions are followed
in order to make it easy for a user to understand the purpose of
a particular object:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b>object.port</b>.&lt;port&gt;
<p>
    Objects under the <b>port</b> namespace should be used for objects
    implementing interfaces on behalf of <b>object</b>.
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <b>object.bank</b>.&lt;bank&gt;
<p>
    The <b>bank</b> namespace is used for objects implementing
    register banks on behalf of <b>object</b>.
  </p></li>
  <li>
    <b>object</b>.&lt;name&gt;
<p>
    Used for all other kinds of objects.
  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>
The <b>object.port</b> and <b>object.bank</b> objects are
just plain namespaces. For specific objects, there might also be
other namespaces that have been assigned a special meaning:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    <b>cpu.vtime</b>.&lt;clock&gt;
<p>
    All CPUs have a <b>vtime</b> object which handles
    event dispatching. Below this objects there are objects
    implementing event queues used by the CPU. There are normally
    at least a <b>cycles</b> object which contains the cycle based
    event queue and a <b>ps</b> object which holds the pico-seconds
    based event queue.
  </p></li>
</ul>
<p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Object-Initialization">33.5 Object Initialization</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The creation of Simics objects is a process which contains several
distinct steps that are executed in a strict sequence. Each step
is performed for all objects under construction before the next
step is attempted. The sequence looks as follows:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
  <li>Space is allocated for all objects under construction by
    calling the <b><i>alloc</i></b> function from the
    corresponding class.
  </li> 
  <li>
    The Simics private parts of the objects are initialized and
    the objects are added to the object hierarchy.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b><i>init</i></b> method is called for each object.
  </li>
  <li>
    Object attributes of the kind <code>Sim_Init_Phase_Pre1</code>
    are set for all objects. Attributes of this kind should only
    be registered by classes provided by Simics Core.
  </li>
  <li>
    Normal attributes are set for all objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    Object attributes marked with <code>Sim_Init_Phase_1</code> are
    set for all objects.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b><i>finalize</i></b> method is called for each object.
    The object is marked as configured.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <b><i>objects_finalized</i></b> method is called for each object.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
The object ordering for each step is defined by the object hierarchy,
with parents being initialized before any descendants. Siblings
are ordered alphanumerically. For the last step,
there can be exceptions to this rule caused by explicit usage of
the <b><i>SIM_require_object</i></b> function from the
<b><i>finalize</i></b> method.
</p><p>
The particulars of the object initialization sequence and
initialization ordering have some implications:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    An object can use the <b><i>SIM_object_descendant</i></b> function
    from its <b><i>init</i></b> method to obtain a reference
    to a child object. This is particularly useful for obtaining
    references to automatically created port objects.
  </li>

  <li>
    A port object can obtain a reference to its port object parent from
    the <b><i>init</i></b> method by using the
    <b><i>SIM_port_object_parent</i></b> function.
  </li>

  <li>
    Objects can propagate default attribute values to children using
    the <b><i>SIM_set_attribute_default</i></b> function.
    This can be done from the <b><i>init</i></b> function but also from
    individual attribute setters.
<p>
    <b>Important:</b> Objects should never set attributes on other
    objects during object construction since this will invariably break
    checkpointing. Setting <em>default</em> attribute values, however,
    is permitted and useful for configuring port objects.
 </p></li>
</ul>
<p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Clock-and-Cell-Inheritance">33.6 Clock and Cell Inheritance</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Each object in Simics has an associated default clock which, among
other things, is used for event posting. The <i>queue</i> attribute
is used to explicitly select a clock for a particular object.
</p><p>
In Simics 6, objects without an explicitly assigned clock
inherit a default one from their respective parents. Thus, in
many cases it is sufficient to just set the <i>queue</i>
attribute for a single object and all descendants will inherit the clock
implicitly.
</p><p>
Note that the <i>queue</i> attribute reflects the explicitly
assigned clock. The <b><i>SIM_object_clock</i></b> function can be used to
retrieve the default clock for a particular object.
</p><p>
Cell membership is also inherited hierarchically.
