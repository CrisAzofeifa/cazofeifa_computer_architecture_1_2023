<p>

The following is a list of changes since the initial Simics
6.0.0 release.
</p><p>
</p><ul><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6196"></a>6.0.13 (build 6196)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Fixed a bug in ERETS that could leave interrupts permanently disabled if
      if the STI interrupt blocking bit was set in the return context.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6188"></a>6.0.11 (build 6188)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      FRED support has been removed from the <b>x86QSP2</b> CPU
      class. Use the <b>x86-experimental-fred</b> CPU class for FRED
      support.
    </li><li>
      Fixed ERETS to raise #GP if CS or SS in the return context do not match
      the current CS or SS.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6176"></a>6.0.10 (build 6176)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Fixed a bug in ERETU that caused incorrect RIP after returning to a code
      segment with non-zero base (bug #14017032910).
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6173"></a>6.0.9 (build 6173)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Updated the ERETS and ERETU instructions to expect RSP to point to RIP of
      the return context, not the error code pushed by event delivery.
    </li><li>
      Updated the ERETU instruction to check that the return CS.RPL and SS.RPL
      fields are 3 even if the selectors match IA32_STAR.
    </li><li>
      Updated the ERETS and ERETU instructions to ignore bits 63:32 of the word
      containing the SS selector.
    </li><li>
      Updated the ERETS and ERETU instructions to not raise #GP if bit 28 of
      the word containing the CS selector is set.
    </li><li>
      Updated the ERETS and ERETU instructions to report the original RSP in
      the exception context if they raise an exception, not the RSP after
      popping parts or all of the return context (bug #14017032184).
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6166"></a>6.0.8 (build 6166)
</p><ul><li><b>APIC</b><ul><li>
      Event queue overflows that could occur in some situations have been fixed
      (bug #16015793807).
    </li></ul></li><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Implemented the changes from version 2.0 to version 3.0 of the FRED
      specification.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6158"></a>6.0.7 (build 6158)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Fixed clearing of RF flag at the start of the next instruction after
      ERETU/ERETS.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6155"></a>6.0.6 (build 6155)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Implemented enumeration of VMX nested-exception support in MSR
      IA32_VMX_BASIC (index 480H) of <b>x86-experimental-fred</b>
      processor class.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6137"></a>6.0.4 (build 6137)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Fixed restoring of segment registers in case if FRED delivery incurs a
      nested exception.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6134"></a>6.0.3 (build 6134)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Fixed VMX guest state check and VMX CR4 capability reporting.
    </li><li>
      Fixed VMX capability reporting.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6127"></a>6.0.2 (build 6127)
</p><ul><li><b>APIC</b><ul><li>
      One-shot and periodic timer modes will use core crystal clock (otherwise
      known as ART) frequency to measure time intervals, if attached processor
      enumerates this frequency in CPUID.0x15. This behavior matches the
      description given in modern SDM.
    </li></ul></li><li><b>Common</b><ul><li>Simics no longer comes with documentation
  in PDF format.</li></ul></li><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Changed the treatment of RPL fields for CS and SS: event delivery ensures
      that SS.RPL in the new context is 0, ERETS generates general-protection
      exception if either CS.RPL or SS.RPL of the return context is not 0.
    </li><li>
      WRMSR to IA32_FRED_CONFIG MSR generates general-protection exception if
      its source operand sets reserved bits. WRMSR to IA32_FRED_RSPx MSRs
      generates general-protection exception if its source operand is not
      64-byte aligned.
    </li><li>
      An execution of far CALL or far JMP instructions that encounters a call
      gate generates general-protection exception. An execution of IRET or far
      RET instructions that would change CPL generates general-protection
      exception.
    </li><li>
      State of STI blocking is now saved on event delivery and restored on ERETS
      execution.
    </li><li>
      ERETU instruction loads CS and SS descriptors now from the GDT
      or LDT as would be done by an execution of IRET (the case 3 of CS
      and SS registers configuration).
    </li><li>
      ERETU instruction generates general-protection exception if it would load
      I/O privilege level (IOPL) with a non-zero value.
    </li><li>
      Delivery of device-not-available exception (#NM) pushes the identity of
      feature triggering #NM, i.e. the value being loaded into IA32_XFD_ERR MSR.
    </li><li>
      Changes to the RSM instruction are implemented.
    </li><li>
      VMX interactions with FRED transitions are implemented.
    </li><li>
      The following changes in draft specification 2.0, June 2021, have been
      implemented:
      <ul>
        <li>They entry point offset for events occurring in ring 0 has changed
            from 64 bytes to 256 bytes.</li>
        <li>CS.L is saved in the event information.</li>
        <li>The instruction length is saved in the event information when an
            event is caused by an INTn, INT1, INT3, INTO, SYSCALL or SYSENTER
            instruction.</li>
        <li>New format used for reporting the cause of #DB.</li>
        <li>Event delivery always clears EFLAGS.TF.</li>
        <li>ERETU clears any pending UMONITOR.</li>
        <li>Interrupt blocking after POP or MOV to SS is disabled when FRED
            is enabled.</li>
      </ul>
    </li><li>
      Added a new <b>x86-experimental-fred</b> processor class.
    </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6096"></a>6.0.1 (build 6096)
</p><ul><li><b>Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED)</b><ul><li>
      Flexible Return and Event Delivery (FRED) feature is supported
      in <code>x86QSP2</code> CPU model as technology preview and is subject to
      change based on customer feedback and internal analysis. The FRED
      implementation has several limitations described in the Limitations
      section. To use the model, set <i>cpu_comp_class</i> parameter
      to <code>x86QSP2</code> before running a Simics script.

<p>

This section describes in detail the known limitations of the
QSP-CPU package. Please refer to
section <a class="reference" href="#Limitations">4</a> for a more general description.
</p><p>
A register or field marked as <i>Not implemented</i> is present with
read-write semantics but has no side effects on simulation. A register
marked as <i>Not implemented (design limitation)</i> has the same
semantics as a "Not implemented" register and there is no
plan to extend the model with this functionality. A register with
<i>Lack of documentation</i> has not been implemented because there is
no available documentation describing its semantics.
