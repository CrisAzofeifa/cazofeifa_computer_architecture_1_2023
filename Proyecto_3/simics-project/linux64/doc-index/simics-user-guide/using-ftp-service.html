<a name="FTP"></a>
The <b>service-node</b> provides a FTP service to support file
transfers with the host using FTP clients on a target machine.
</p><p>
Assuming a <b>service-node</b> has been created, and that it
is named <code>default_service_node0</code>, the FTP-service will be named
<code>default_service_node0.ftp</code>.
The service node must be configured with an IP address and connected to a link
before the FTP service can be enabled and configured.
The FTP root directory, the location
on the host system for transferred files, can be set by the
<b>set-ftp-directory</b> command. The default root directory is
the current directory for the Simics session, usually your project
directory.
</p><p>
On a target that runs Clear Linux there is usually a <b>curl</b> command
for transferring data using various protocols, it can put a file to the server
and retrieve a file from the server.
</p><p>
Here is an example on using the FTP service on a target
running <i>Firststeps</i> with a network. Start Simics
and run the following commands:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; run-command-file "targets/qsp-x86/firststeps.simics"
simics&gt; default_service_node0.set-ftp-directory dir = "/tmp/"
</pre><p>
A <i>Firststeps</i> target was created. The target
machine's IP address is 10.10.0.1 and it contains
a <b>default_service_node0</b> with the FTP service. The root
directory was set to the <code>/tmp/</code> directory on the
host file system.
</p><p>
Continue the simulation until a prompt is reached.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; c</pre><p>
When prompt has been reached, the <b>curl</b> command can be run
in the text console.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~ # curl -T /etc/hostname ftp://10.10.0.1/targetfile.txt</pre><p>
The contents of the target file <code>/etc/hostname</code> has now
been sent to the host file <code>targetfile.txt</code> in the path
set from the <b>set-ftp-directory</b> command. In similar way:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">~ # curl ftp://10.10.0.1/targetfile.txt -o hostfile.txt</pre><p>
will retrieve a file, <code>targetfile.txt</code>, from the host and
save it as <code>hostfile.txt</code> on the target.
</p><p>
Using other kind of distributions of Linux than Clear Linux there will
most likely exist a <b>ftp</b> command in the shell for running
a ftp client. An example on how to put a file to the host:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">#&gt; <b>ftp 10.10.0.1</b>
Connected to 10.10.0.1.
220 Welcome to the Simics FTP server
Name (10.10.0.1:simics): <b>&lt;enter&gt;</b>
230 User logged in
ftp&gt; <b>put /proc/cpuinfo targetfile.txt</b>

200 OK
150 transfer about to start
226 file transfer done
6520 bytes sent in 0.00 secs (12734.4 kB/s)</pre><p>
</p><p>
If running Microsoft Windows as target then Windows Internet Explorer
can be used as client to connect to the FTP service by
entering <a class="jdocu" href="ftp://10.10.0.1">ftp://10.10.0.1</a> as address. This will allow transfer
from host to target. To be able to transfer files back to the host you
will need to select
<b>Page â†’ Open FTP Site in Windows Explorer</b>.
