</p><p>
  Simics Agent is a feature in Simics which can be used to move files and
  directories in and out of a simulation in a deterministic way, without any
  network connection or kernel modules. It also provides a deterministic way of
  executing commands on the target systems and knowing when they finish.
</p><p>
  This feature consists of two parts. One part is present inside a Simics
  simulation session (<b>agent_manager</b> and
  <b>agent_handler</b> objects) and the other part is
  the <code>simics-agent</code> application running on the target system.
</p><p>
  The <code>simics-agent</code> application must be located on the target system
  and the user is in charge of starting it. The application as well as the
  target system must be running for its commands to execute. There is typically
  just a single Simics Agent in a target system, but there may be more target
  systems and agents.
</p><p>
  The user has to create the <b>agent_manager</b> object with
  the <b>start-agent-manager</b> Simics command.
  The object will find running Simics Agents and keep track of them. There can
  be only one <b>agent_manager</b> in Simics session.
</p><p>
  In order to control and issue commands to a Simics Agent, the user must run
  the <b>&lt;agent_manager&gt;.connect-to-agent</b> command, which returns a
  unique <b>agent_handle</b> for the Simics Agent. Several handles may
  be connected to one Simics Agent, which are executing commands concurrently.
</p><p>
  All the commands that the <b>agent_handle</b> provides are
  asynchronous and queued in the handle until they have completed. Handles can
  be created and used in scripts, script-branches, or interactively on the
  Simics command-line. The two commands,
  <b>&lt;agent_handle&gt;.run-until-job</b> and
  <b>&lt;agent_handle&gt;.wait-for-job</b>, allow the user to wait until a
  particular or all queued commands have finished.
</p><p>
  Exactly <em>when</em> a Simics Agent runs and executes a particular command
  is defined by the target system, neither Simics nor the user can control it.
</p><p>
  A ready-to-use Simics Agent is installed on some virtual platform images.
  Agents for some architectures are also available on CD (ISO) in the
  <code></code><i>[simics-base]</i><code>/targets/common/images/</code> directory.
  For other use cases, the agent source code comes with Simics Base
  and can be copied onto and compiled for the target system, usually
  without, or with only minor, adjustments. The source code is located
  at <code></code><i>[simics-base]</i><code>/src/misc/simics-agent/</code>.
</p><p>
  A Simics Agent runs only when needed, otherwise it sleeps and regularly polls
  for requests. Agent responsiveness versus performance taxing is a trade-off
  that is controlled by the polling interval, but affects all users of that
  Simics Agent.
</p><p>
  </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
If reverse execution is enabled, any command given to Simics Agent will
    replace any older bookmarks with a reverse execution barrier at the current
    time.
  </div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
A checkpoint will contain Simics Agents and the Agent Manager, but not any
    Agent Handles. Thus, any ongoing transactions or pending commands are lost
    and must be rerun.
  </div>The following sections shows an example where a binary is uploaded to the
  target system, started, and its output file downloaded to the host. See the
  <em>Simics Reference Manual</em> or command-line interface help for
  details on <b>agent_manager</b> and <b>agent_handle</b>
  classes and the methods they provide.
<p>
  The examples assume that a target system is booted and a Simics Agent is
  running on it. All but the first example expects the simulation to be running.
</p><p>
  Creating a Simics Agent Manager is done once per simulation session, both
  for interactive use and for scripts.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>start-agent-manager</b>
agent-manager 'agent_manager' is created and enabled.
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Interactive-Example">7.1.1 Interactive Example</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  The <b>agent_manager</b> was started above, but the user needs an
  <b>agent_handle</b> to issue commands to. The connect command below
  will return immediately, whether the simulation is running or not, and whether
  there is any known Simics Agents matching the requested identity or not. Since
  no name was given, the returned handle will have the default name.
</p><p>
  It is recommended, but not required, to issue commands while the simulation is
  stopped, like in this example, for the sake of determinism and repeatability.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>agent_manager.connect-to-agent</b>
matic0 connected to simics_agent0
simics&gt; <b>matic0.upload -executable my_test /bin/</b>
matic0:job 1
simics&gt; <b>matic0.run "/bin/my_test -out /var/my_test.log"</b>
matic0:job 2
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  Now two commands have been given, but since the simulation is stopped they
  will not execute yet. The first command will upload the application binary and
  make it executable (if it isn't already), while the second command will run
  it. The queued commands can be listed along with their sequence id's.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; matic0.list-jobs
	#1	upload my_test /bin/my_test, queued
	#2	run "/bin/my_test -out /var/my_test.log", queued

  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  Note that the <b>&lt;agent_handle&gt;.list-jobs</b> command does not
  require the simulation to be running (nor even a Simics Agent to exist).
  Then, run the queued commands and wait for them to complete.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>matic0.run-until-job</b>
File my_test copied from host to target /bin/my_test
... [the output of the my_test command, if any] ...
matic0:job 2 finished
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  The test application produced an output log file that should be downloaded
  from the simulation to the host. When downloading files the user may want to
  specify the <code>-overwrite</code> flag. Otherwise the file will not be
  downloaded on following runs, as the file will persist on the host.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>matic0.download -overwrite /var/my_test.log</b>
matic0:job 3
simics&gt; <b>matic0.run-until-job</b>
File /var/my_test.log copied from target to host ./my_test.log
matic0:job 3 finished
  </pre><p>
</p><p>

  </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Example-with-a-Script-Branch">7.1.2 Example with a Script Branch</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  This example will perform the same tasks as the previous example, but in a
  script-branch. The handle will automatically run the queued commands one after
  another in strict order, and they will complete in due time. Technically, the
  script-branch will queue all commands up until a
  <b>&lt;agent_handle&gt;.wait-for-job</b> command and only then wait for
  them to finish.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>script-branch "run my_test" {
    local $matic = (agent_manager.connect-to-agent)
    $matic.upload -executable from = my_test to = /bin/
    $job = ($matic.run -capture "/bin/my_test -out /var/my_test.log")
    $matic.download -overwrite /var/my_test.log
    $matic.wait-for-job</b>  # wait until ALL jobs are done <b>
    echo ($matic.get-captured-output $job)
    $matic.delete-handle
}</b>
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  This example prints the output of the <code>my_test</code> application, but
  requires a <b>wait-for-job</b> command, because without it the application
  will not have run before the script-branch reaches the echo statement and then
  deletes the handle.
</p><p>
  It is good practice to delete any lingering objects in the end of a script
  branch. The output of the my_test command is captured and printed, but can
  alternatively be written to a file instead.
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">File my_test copied from host to target /bin/my_test
File /var/my_test.log copied from target to host ./my_test.log
... [the output of the my_test command, if any] ...
  </pre><p>
</p><p>

  </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Example-from-the-target-shell">7.1.3 Example from the target shell</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  Similar to the previous examples, a test log file will be copied from the
  target system to the host system. Here, the execution is controlled completely
  from the command-line in the target system shell.
</p><p>
  </p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The direction of the upload and download commands are reversed, when giving
    the commands from the target system, compared to the host system.
  </div><pre class="jdocu_small">~ # <b>simics-agent --executable --download my_test --to /bin/</b>
File my_test copied from host to target /bin/my_test
The Simics target agent has quit.
~ # <b>my_test -out /var/my_test.log</b>
...
~ # <b>simics-agent --overwrite --upload /var/my_test.log</b>
File /var/my_test.log copied from target to host ./my_test.log
The Simics target agent has quit.
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  Give the <code>--help</code> argument to the <b>simics-agent</b> for more
  information on the available commands and options.
</p><p>
  For these target initiated commands to work, the Agent Manager must be started
  on the host, but no Simics Agents are required to be running in the target
  system. Different Simics Agents and using them will not conflict or interfere
  with each other.
