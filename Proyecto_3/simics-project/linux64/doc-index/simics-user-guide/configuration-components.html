<p>

</p><p>
All machines in
<code>[simics]\targets\</code><i>architecture</i><code></code> use
components to create configurations. A component is typically the
smallest hardware unit that can be used when configuring a real
machine, and examples include motherboards, PCI cards, hard disks, and
backplanes. Components are usually implemented in Simics using several
configuration objects and can also contain subcomponents.
</p><p>
Components are intended to reduce the large configuration space provided by
Simics's objects and attributes, by only allowing combinations that match real
hardware. This greatly simplifies the creation of different systems by catching
many misconfigurations.
</p><p>
Components themselves are also configuration objects in Simics. But to avoid
confusion, they will always be referred to as components and the objects
implementing the actual functionality will be called objects.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Component-Definitions">6.4.1 Component Definitions</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="component"></a>
</p><p>
The <em><a name="component2">component</a></em> is the basic building block in the
component system. When a component is created, it is in
a <em>non-instantiated</em> state. At this stage only the component
itself exists, not the configuration objects that will implement the
actual functionality. Once a complete configuration has been created,
all included components can be <em>instantiated</em>. When this
happens, all objects are created and their attributes are set.
</p><p>
Components are connected to each other with
<em><a name="connector">connector</a>s</em>. Each connector has
a <em><a name="connector-type">connector type</a></em> which tells what kind of
connector it is and a <em>direction</em>, which can
be <em>up</em>, <em>down</em>, or <em>any</em>. A connector is either
required or optional. If it is optional it does not need to be
connected to anything. Unless a connector is specified
as <em>hotpluggable</em> it cannot be connected or disconnected after
the component is instantiated. If a connection is hotpluggable it must
be optional.
</p><p>
Connectors can be connected to each other in <em><a name="connection">connection</a>s</em>.
Each connection connects an <em>up</em> connector with a <em>down</em>
connector. A connection can also include an <em>any</em> connector. If
an <em>any</em> connector is connected to an <em>up</em> connector it works
exactly like a <em>down</em> connector and if it is connected to a <em>down</em>
connector it works exactly like an <em>up</em> connector. The connections in the
system must not form a cycle. You can think of the components and connections in
the system as a directed acyclic graph with the components as the vertices and
the connections as the edges.
</p><p>
Each connected subgraph in the set of components is called
a <em><a name="component-hierarchy">component hierarchy</a></em>.
</p><p>
A component <em>A</em> is said to be <em>above</em> a component <em>B</em> if it
can be reached through up connectors in one or more steps from component
<em>B</em>. Analogously, component <em>A</em> is said to be <em>below</em> a
component <em>B</em> if <em>B</em> is above <em>A</em>.
</p><p>
A <em>root</em> is a component without any components above it. A
component's roots are the roots which are above it.
</p><p>
A component where the <i>top_level</i> attribute returns true is
a <em>top-level</em> component. It is often a motherboard, backplane
or system chassis. It must be a root.
</p><p>
A <em>standalone</em> component is a component without any required
connectors. A typical example is a hotplug device, such as a PC Card
(PCMCIA) or an Ethernet link.
</p><p>
To instantiate a set of components, each component which is not
standalone or top-level must have a top-level component as a root.
</p><p>
Components are also <em><a name="namespace">namespace</a>s</em> and can be nested in a
<em><a name="namespace-hierarchy">namespace hierarchy</a></em>, which is separate from the component
hierarchy. The root of the hierarchy is the <em>global namespace</em>,
and this is the only namespace which is not a component. Each
configuration object (including components) lives in a namespace. The
object is a <em>child</em> of the namespace and the namespace is the
<em>parent</em> of the object. The other objects in the namespace are
<em>siblings</em> of the object.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Importing-Component-Commands">6.4.2 Importing Component Commands</a></h2>
<p>

Components in Simics are grouped by machine architecture, or by type, into
several modules. Before a component can be used in Simics, the
corresponding component module has to be loaded. When the component module
is loaded, CLI commands for creating components are added to the front end. The
most common modules, that are not architecture specific, are
<code>memory-comp</code>, <code>pci-comp</code>, <code>std-comp</code>,
<code>console-components</code>. To import all modules that are used by
the <i>QSP-Simple</i> machine, issue the
following commands:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module std-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>load-module memory-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>load-module console-components</b>
simics&gt; <b>load-module x58-ich10-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>load-module x86-nehalem-comp</b>
</pre><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Creating-Components">6.4.3 Creating Components</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The <b>create-&lt;component&gt;</b> command is used to create
non-instantiated components. There is one create command for each
component class.  The arguments to the create command represent
attributes in the component.  Standalone components can be created
both non-instantiated and instantiated.  To create instantiated
components, there are <b>new-</b> commands, similar to
the <b>create-</b> commands.
</p><p>
The following code creates a non-instantiated 'motherboard_x58_ich10' component
, called 'motherboard0'
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module x58-ich10-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>create-motherboard-x58-ich10</b>
Created non-instantiated 'motherboard_x58_ich10' component 'motherboard0'
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="machine-configuration-components-connector">6.4.4 Connectors</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="connector2"></a><a name="component3"></a>
</p><p>
A connector provides a means for a component to connect to other components.
Connectors have a defined direction: <i>up</i>, <i>down</i>, or <i>any</i>.
The direction is <i>up</i> if it needs an existing hierarchy to connect to;
for example, the PCI-bus connector in a PCI device must connect to a PCI slot.
A connector has a <i>down</i> direction if it extends the hierarchy downwards;
for example, a PCI slot is a connection downward from a board to a PCI device.
There are also non-directed connectors, with direction <i>any</i>. You can
only connect an <em>up</em> to a <em>down</em> connector or to an <em>any</em>
connector, and similar for <em>down</em> connectors. Connectors with the
<em>any</em> direction can not be connected together.
</p><p>
Many connectors have to be connected before the component is instantiated,
while others can be empty. A standalone component, as described above,
may have all connectors empty.
</p><p>
A <em>hotplug</em> connector supports connect and disconnect after
instantiation. Other connectors can only be connected, or left
unconnected, when the configuration is created and may not be modified
after that point.  A <em>multi</em> connector supports connections to
several other connectors. Creating <em>multi</em> connectors should be
avoided, it is often better to dynamically create non-<em>multi</em>
connectors when new connectors are needed.
</p><p>
It is not possible to connect instantiated components with non-instantiated
ones. The reason is that the instantiated component expects the other to have
all objects already created, and need to access some of them to finish the
connection.
</p><p>
The <b>info</b> command of a component lists all connectors and some
information about them:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>motherboard0.info</b>

    socket[5] : x86-apic-processor   down
    socket[6] : x86-apic-processor   down
    socket[7] : x86-apic-processor   down

</pre><p>
The board has four slots for memory modules, one north bridge, one reset bus, 
one south bridge, eight sockets. All slots are not listed as <em>hotplug</em> 
since they have to be inserted when the machine is configured initially.
</p><p>
Since the machine need a cpu, we also add a x86QSP1 processor to our example. 
A CLI variable is used to hold the name of the processor component.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module x86-nehalem-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>$cpu = (create-processor-x86QSP1 freq_mhz = 2000)</b>
simics&gt; <b>connect motherboard0.socket[0] $cpu.socket</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To enable input and output for the simulated machine, the following commands
create a serial text console and connect it to the <code>serial[0]</code> connector
of the south bridge.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module console-components</b>
simics&gt; <b>connect motherboard0.sb.serial[0] (create-txt-console-comp).serial</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Since the machine needs some memory to run, we also add a memory module to
our example. A CLI variable is used to hold the name of the memory component.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>load-module memory-comp</b>
simics&gt; <b>$dimm = (create-simple-memory-module memory_megs = 2048)</b>
simics&gt; <b>connect motherboard0.dimm[0] $dimm.mem_bus</b>
</pre><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Instantiation">6.4.5 Instantiation</a></h2>
<p>

When a component hierarchy has been created, it can be instantiated using the
<b>instantiate-components</b> command. This command will look for all
non-instantiated top-level components and instantiate all components below
them. The <b>instantiate-components</b> command can also be given
a specific component as argument. Then only that component will be
instantiated, including its hierarchy if it is a top-level component.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>instantiate-components</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
If there are unconnected connectors left that may not be empty, the command
will return with an error.
</p><p>
When the instantiation is ready, all object and attributes have been
created and initialized. In our example, a text console window should
have opened.  The hardware of the simulated motherboard is now
properly configured, but since no software is loaded, it will not show
any output on the console if the machine is started.
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Inspecting-Component-Configurations">6.4.6 Inspecting Component Configurations</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The <b>list-components</b> command prints a list of all components in the
system. All connectors are included, and information about existing
connections between them.
</p><p>
The <b>info</b> namespace command provides static information about a
component, such as the slots and a list of connectors.
</p><p>
The <b>status</b> namespace command provides dynamic information about a
component, such as attribute values and a list of all current connections. The
output from status in the example:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>motherboard0.status</b>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Accessing-Objects-from-Components">6.4.7 Accessing Objects from Components</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
When doing more advanced configuration of a machine, it may be
necessary to access configuration objects and their attributes
directly. Each object in a component has a slot name that can be used
for accessing the object. A list of slot names, and their mappings to
actual configuration object names, is available from the output of the
component's <b>info</b> command. The next example prints the 
<i>frequency</i> attribute from the <i>core</i> object.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>processor0.core[0][0]-&gt;frequency</b>
[20000000, 1]
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Accessing objects of non-instantiated components is not possible, since
they do not have any associated configuration objects. But it is
possible to access the <code>pre_conf_object</code>s of a
non-instantiated component from Python. The following
example works both for instantiated and non-instantiated components:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>@print(conf.processor0.core[0][0].cpuid_stepping)</b>
8
</pre><p>
Remember that not all configuration object attributes are available on a
<code>pre_conf_object</code>. Only attributes that have been assigned by
the component during initialization exists.
</p><p>
