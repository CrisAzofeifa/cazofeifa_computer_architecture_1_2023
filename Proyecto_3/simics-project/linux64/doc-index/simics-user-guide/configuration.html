</p><p>
Simics includes a <em>configuration system</em> used to describe the state of
the simulated machines.
</p><p>
Simics's configuration system is object-oriented: a simulated machine is
represented as a set of <em>objects</em> that interact when the simulated time
advances. Typically, processors, memories and devices are modeled as
objects. Each object is defined by a number of properties that are called
<em>attributes</em>. A processor object, for example, will have an attribute
called <i>freq_mhz</i> to define its clock frequency (in MHz).
</p><p>
Simics's configuration system is flexible: it is possible to create and delete
objects dynamically, as well as access the attributes of all objects for
reading and writing at any time.
</p><p>
Simics's configuration system allows its elements to be saved so that a complete
simulated machine state can be written to a set of files. This set of files is
called a <em>checkpoint</em>.
</p><p>
This chapter describes the Simics configuration system as well as the different
layers built on top of it to handle more specific tasks:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

  <li>Checkpoints: how a simulated state is saved and restored via
  checkpointing;</li>

  <li>Inspection: how the simulated state can be examined and changed during
  simulation;</li>

  <li>Start Scripts: the components and scripts used to define the initial
  state of a machine in the examples provided with Simics.</li>

<div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Not all kinds of connections with real network, or with real file systems,
  will continue to work properly if you pause the simulation for a shorter or
  lengthier time. This applies to most stateful connections, for example NFS,
  TCP, etc.
<p>
  For the same reason, not all kinds of connections with the real world can be
  saved in a checkpoint and successfully restored at a later time. Hence, make
  a habit to disconnect such services before pausing the simulation, or before
  saving a checkpoint.
