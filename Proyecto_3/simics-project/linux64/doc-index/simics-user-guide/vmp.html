</p><p>
The VMP add-on for Simics makes use of hardware virtualization support
to provide vastly improved performance when simulating x86-based
systems. It is an optional part of the x86-based models.
</p><p>
The VMP feature requires that the host machine running Simics has the
Intel® Virtualization Technology (Intel® VT) for IA-32, Intel® 64
and Intel® Architecture (Intel® VT-x) enabled in the host machine
firmware (the BIOS).
</p><p>
Almost all Intel® processors since the original Core™ architecture,
including Xeon® server processors, support the Intel® VT-x feature
set. See the Intel® ARK at ark.intel.com for information on specific
products.
</p><p>
The Intel® VT-x virtualization feature and the NX execute protection
feature must also be enabled in the host machine firmware to run VMP. Look for
options under either <em>Security</em> or <em>Virtualization</em> to find
where to enable Intel® VT and NX in your firmware. If Intel® Trusted
Execution Technology (TXT) is enabled in the firmware, it can also happen that
the Intel® VT-x virtualization feature is restricted to trusted
applications only; there is usually a special firmware setting controlling
this behavior. VMP requires Intel® VT-x to be generally available.
</p><p>
All major features of Simics, including full inspectability of
simulated state, ability to model heterogeneous systems, and reverse
execution, are fully supported when running with VMP.

<p>

</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Linux">16.6.1.1 Linux</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Installing and managing VMP kernel modules requires sudo
privileges. Installing will compile the kernel module and therefore
also requires an environment to build kernel modules. Which packages
you need for building kernel modules depend on the distribution of
Linux that you are using, but at least for certain Red Hat based
distributions you would
need <code>gcc-c++</code>, <code>kernel-headers</code>,
and <code>kernel-devel</code>. Change directory to the Simics Base package
and run:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>bin/vmp-kernel-install</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The script will compile and persistently install the kernel modules
that are used by VMP. It will echo what needs to be done, which
involves running scripts in the <code>vmxmon/scripts/</code>
directory.
</p><p>
Disable VMP temporarily by running
the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-unload</code> script, and enable VMP with
the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-load</code> script. Permanently uninstall VMP
from your host by running the <code>bin/vmp-kernel-uninstall</code>
script.
</p><p>
If your installation is read-only, or you for some other reason want
to have the built VMP artifacts outside of the installation, you can
give a directory to the relevant VMP scripts, example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer$ <b>bin/vmp-kernel-install /somewhere/directory</b>
joe@computer$ <b>bin/vmp-kernel-load /somewhere/directory</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Windows">16.6.1.2 Windows</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
The kernel module can be loaded and unloaded by running
the <code>bin\vmp-kernel-load.bat</code>
respective <code>bin\vmp-kernel-unload.bat</code> scripts as
administrator. To do that, open a command shell as administrator and run:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>bin\vmp-kernel-load.bat</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Another way to perform the same action would be to right-click on
<code>vmp-kernel-load.bat</code> and select run as administrator.
</p><p>
The /AUTO and /DEMAND options select the start option for the VMP
service. With /AUTO (default), the service will be available after
restart whereas with /DEMAND (which used to be the behavior before
these flags were added) will mean that the service is only available
until shutdown or reboot and then has to be manually loaded again if
needed.
</p><p>
If the script fails, see the Windows event log for more
information. The most common reason is that Intel® VT-x technology or the NX
feature is not enabled in the BIOS. The kernel module will also fail
to load if Windows is running with the Hyper-V feature enabled.

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="Hyper-V-Interaction">16.6.1.3 Hyper-V Interaction</a></h3>
<p>

Windows 8 and later can be run with Hyper-V enabled. Hyper-V is a feature
where the operating system is run as a guest under the control of a hypervisor.
VMP cannot be used in conjunction with Hyper-V: loading the VMP kernel module
will fail.
</p><p>
There are various ways to disable the Hyper-V feature. Below are instructions
for adding an additional boot configuration database entry to make it easy
to boot with Hyper-V disabled:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li> Open cmd prompt as <b>administrator</b>. In the admin prompt,
  run the following command to duplicate the current boot configuration entry:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>bcdedit /copy {current} /d "Win 8.1 with Hyper-V disabled"</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
This will print the id of the newly created entry, e.g.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">The entry was successfully copied to {41f7b750-485b-4f02-9d0e-4c8e3d02c31d}.
</pre><p>
</p></li>

<li>
Run the following command (replace the id below with the id just printed):
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"><b>bcdedit /set {41f7b750-485b-4f02-9d0e-4c8e3d02c31d} hypervisorlaunchtype off</b>
</pre><p>
</p></li>

<li>
Restart the computer with boot option selection (click on Restart while
holding down the shift key). Windows will present a blue screen where you
can select the newly created boot entry.
</li>
</ul>

<p>

<p>

</p><p>
With the VMP kernel modules installed, VMP will be enabled by default
for each processor. You can disable VMP by running
the <b>disable-vmp</b> command.
</p><p>
Due to details about how the Intel® VT feature that VMP is based on
works, the acceleration may not kick in. Use the system-perfmeter to
find out if a processor actually uses the VMP execution mode. To find
out why VMP is not used, either raise the log level of the CPU in
question or use the <b>info</b> command on the CPU.
</p><p>

</p><p>
The VMP packages are currently available and supported for
Linux and Windows.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Due to bugs in the performance counters on many Intel CPU types,
precise instruction counting cannot be achieved with VMP. The only CPU
types that we are aware of that do not have this bug is Intel®
Core™ Duo/Solo, and Pentium® 4 processors. To still be able
to use reverse execution with VMP, Simics will automatically adjust
the timing when re-running to line up with the original forward
run. However, when running in regular forward mode slight differences
in timing between runs will appear and cannot be avoided due to the
bug in the underlying hardware.
</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Software using hardware virtualization frequently have problems
co-existing on a machine. If you are running other software using
hardware virtualization such as VMware, VirtualBox, KVM, or
Intel® Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (Intel® HAXM),
you may need to unload the driver corresponding to that software before
using VMP.
</div>Note that virtualizers such as VMware or Xen in most versions do not
expose the Intel® VT feature. Even virtualizers that do expose the
Intel® VT feature are likely to either lack support for the
performance counters needed to run with VMP, or will have very
different performance characteristics compared to native solutions. To
summarize, it is highly recommended that VMP is run in a
non-virtualized environment.
<p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Differences-Between-VMP-and-non-VMP">16.6.4 Differences Between VMP and non-VMP</a></h2>
<p>

VMP is designed to be a transparent performance enhancement. The
implementation with Intel® VT-x makes that impossible in some areas, and
in some other areas we have taken the chance to utilize the VMP mode to tweak
performance further. Enabling features that cannot be emulated using
Intel® VT-x will automatically disable VMP.
</p><p>
VMP is optimized for software development, and the default timing
parameters used in VMP reflect that. The timing settings can be viewed
with the <b>info</b> command on the CPU object. As default, VMP
timing will stall the PAUSE instruction, the RDTSC instruction, and
each port-mapped I/O access for 10 milliseconds. These stalls are
added to allow loops containing these operations to consume more
virtual time per iteration and therefore speed up simulation if the
loop is terminated after a set virtual time. This is controlled by
attributes in the CPU object and can be changed if somewhat more
realistic timing is more important than maximum simulation speed.
</p><p>
The hardware performance counters are used to figure out the number of
executed instructions when running in VMP mode. Since those counters
count string instructions as one regardless of the number of
iterations, this is the instruction count model that must be used to
enable VMP. This is controlled by the one_step_per_string_instruction
attribute, and setting that to classic counting will disable VMP.
</p><p>
The TLB model is bypassed in VMP mode. To simulate a particular
configuration of the TLB, or listen to the haps that the TLB model
generates, VMP has to be manually disabled.
