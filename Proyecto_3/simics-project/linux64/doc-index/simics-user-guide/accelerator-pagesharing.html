</p><p>
When running multiple instances of the same target system, in a
virtual network or similar, it is likely that many of the RAM, ROM,
flash, or disk pages in each system are identical to the
others. Simics Accelerator adds a new <i>page-sharing</i> feature which takes
advantage of this fact to reduce host memory consumption and increase
execution performance.
</p><p>
When the page-sharing feature is activated, at certain trigger points
Simics will examine the contents of a page, comparing it with other pages
examined earlier. If an identical match is found, the page is removed
and instead set to share data with the other page(s).
</p><p>
When many pages are shared the host memory that Simics uses will be
reduced and consequently it will take longer until the memory-limit
is reached. If the frequency of reaching Simics memory-limit is a factor
limiting performance, execution performance will also increase.
Simics can also take advantage of the fact that the page is shared by
sharing the generated JIT code corresponding to a shared page.
This can lead to improved performance since the JIT code only needs
to be created once, but also thanks to better instruction caching when
many target processors use the same JIT code.
</p><p>
Shared pages are always read-only, if a shared page is written to, it
will automatically be un-shared and the writer will be given a
private copy of the page. Consequently, page-sharing works best for
pages containing only instructions or data pages which are never or
rarely modified.
</p><p>
To activate page-sharing, use the command <b>enable-page-sharing</b>.
This command also has a <i>-now</i> command argument which
causes all pages to be analyzed and possibly shared directly.
</p><p>
To monitor how much memory that is saved due to the page-sharing
feature, the <b>system-perfmeter</b> has a <i>-shared</i>
switch which shows how much memory in total that has been saved, in
each measurement sample. (See chapter <em>Performance</em>
in the <em>Simics User's Guide</em>.)
</p><p>
Use <b>disable-page-sharing</b> to deactivate the page-sharing
feature. This will not cause already shared pages to be un-shared but
no more pages will be shared.
