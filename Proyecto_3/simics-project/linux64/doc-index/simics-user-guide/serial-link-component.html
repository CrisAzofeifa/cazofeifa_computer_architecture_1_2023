<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="Serial-Link-Component">8.1 Serial Link Component</a></h1>
<p>

</p><p>
Connecting simulated machines over a simulated <a name="serial">serial</a>
connection is done by creating a <b>ser-link</b> component
that connects to the serial devices in the machines. The link object
can be thought of as modeling a serial cable that is plugged into the
connectors on the devices—and just like a real cable, it is a
point-to-point connection that connects exactly two devices.
</p><p>
The <a name="link">link</a> object models serial communication at the character level
in a simplified way. The bandwidth for the connection is configured in the link
object, which means that the serial devices do not need to be explicitly
configured by software.
</p><p>
New <b>ser-link</b> components can be added with the
<b>new-ser-link</b> command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"> 
simics&gt; <b>load-module ser-link</b>
simics&gt; <b>new-ser-link</b>
Created instantiated 'ser_link' component 'serial_link0'
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Serial connectors of other components can then connect to that
link. The serial link has two connectors, <b>device0</b>
and <b>device1</b>, representing the two endpoints of the
cable. For an <i>QSP-x86</i> machine, the second
UART can be connected to the link the following way:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"> 
simics&gt; <b>connect serial_link0.device0 board.mb.sb.serial[2]</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Text-and-Telnet-Consoles">8.1.1 Text and Telnet Consoles</a></h2>
<p>
</p><p>
In addition to simulated serial devices, either endpoint of a serial
link can be hooked up to a text console. (And just
as with serial devices, you have the option of connecting the two
endpoints directly without having a link in between—though this
is generally much more useful with consoles.)
</p><p>
A text console can open GUI windows on the host computer, and let
the user talk to the connected serial device. The text console also
has the ability to start a telnet server; the user can then use any
telnet program to connect to this server, and talk to the connected
serial device.
</p><p>
You create text consoles by instantiating
<b>txt_console_comp</b> components, and connecting them to
the link or device you want them to talk to, as in the following example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"> 
simics&gt; <b>new-txt-console-comp con visible=TRUE</b>
simics&gt; <b>connect con.serial board.mb.sb.serial[2]</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
