As mentioned above, Simics's configuration system is object-oriented. A Simics
object is instantiated from a Simics <em>class</em>. The core of Simics defines
some useful classes, but most of the classes (processors, device models,
statistic gathering extensions) are provided by <em>modules</em> that are
loaded by the simulator when requested.
</p><p>
For example, the <b>x86-p4</b> module defines, not surprisingly, the
<b>x86-p4</b> class. Note that a module may define several
classes. Since modules advertise the classes they define, Simics can load
modules transparently as objects are instantiated.
</p><p>
A class defines <em>attributes</em> that represent both the static and dynamic
state of the instantiated objects. The static state includes information that
does not change during the simulation (like a version number in a register)
while the dynamic state covers the part of the device that are affected by the
simulation (registers, internal state, buffers, etc.).
</p><p>
Let us take the example of an x86-p4 processor and have a closer look at how
it can be configured using attributes:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>We can create an object instantiated from the class
<b>x86-p4</b>. Let us call it <b>cpu0</b></li>

<li>The attribute <i>freq_mhz</i> can be set to 1500. It defines the
processor clock frequency (in MHz)</li>

<li>The attribute <i>physical_memory</i> can be set to a memory space
object, such as <b>phys_mem0</b>. This attribute points to the object that
will answer to the memory accesses coming from the processor.</li>

</ul>
<p>
As you noticed, attributes may be of various types. A complete description is
available in the next section.
