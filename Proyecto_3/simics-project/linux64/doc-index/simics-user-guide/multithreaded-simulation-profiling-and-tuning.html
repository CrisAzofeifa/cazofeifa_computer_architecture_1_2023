With Simics Accelerator, simulation performance can be increased by
utilizing host system parallelism. Simics exploits available
target system parallelism and spreads the load over available host
cores, in order to increase performance.
</p><p>
Simics Accelerator has two different mechanisms that can operate alone
or work together to improve performance. The first
is Simics® <em>Multimachine Accelerator</em> which is based upon the cell
concept. The other mechanism is <em>Multicore Accelerator</em> which
can parallelize simulation even within cells.
</p><p>
A cell ideally contains tightly coupled parts of the target system
(typically one or more CPUs and associated devices). Different cells
can be simulated in parallel with <em>Multimachine Accelerator</em>
(which is default on), but unless <em>Multicore Accelerator</em> is
enabled (default off), a single cell will be simulated in a
single-threaded fashion (see chapter <a class="reference" href="scaling-simics.html">17</a>
for more details).
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="mtprof2">16.2.1 Simics® Multimachine Accelerator</a></h2>
<p>

The Multithreaded Simulation Profiler tool (<b>mtprof</b>) can be
used to analyze some performance aspects of multithreaded simulation.
Mtprof is primarily useful to
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>detect parallelism bottlenecks</li>
<li>predict how fast the simulation would run on a more parallel host machine</li>
<li>provide some insights into the performance impact of various latency setting.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Multithreaded Simulation Profiler helps in understanding threading
behavior at the Multimachine Accelerator level. There is no explicit
tool support for optimizing specific Multicore Accelerator issues.
</p><p>
The Multithreaded Simulation Profiler is started with the following command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>enable-mtprof</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When mtprof is enabled, Simics keeps track of how much CPU time is spent
simulating each cell in the system. Once Simics has been running for a while,
it is possible to ask mtprof for an overview:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>mtprof.cellstat</b>
============================================================
  cellname                    rt   %elapsed  %cputime
------------------------------------------------------------
  ebony3.cell3             77.0s     93.6%    80.0% 
  ebony1.cell1              8.9s     10.9%     9.3% 
  ebony2.cell2              8.2s     10.0%     8.5% 
  ebony0.cell0              2.1s      2.5%     2.1% 
------------------------------------------------------------
  elapsed_realtime         82.2s    100.0%    85.5%
============================================================
</pre><p>
</p><p>
From the above output, we can conclude that cell3 is a
limiting factor: the other cells frequently have to wait upon
this cell in order to keep the virtual time in sync. Investigating
why cell3 is so expensive to simulate is the next natural step:
there might be an expensive poll loop or the idle
optimization might not function properly, for instance. Other potential
ways to address the load imbalance include
</p><ul>
<li>enabling <em>Multicore Accelerator</em> for the cell if applicable</li>
<li>splitting cell3 into multiple cells (if it contains multiple CPUs and Multicore Accelerator is not applicable)</li>
<li>changing the step rate of CPUs belonging to cell3.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The mtprof tool can also be used to estimate how fast the simulation
would run on a machine with enough host cores
to allow Simics to assign a dedicated host core to each cell:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>mtprof.modelstat</b>
============================================================
  latency      rt_model  realtime/rt_model
------------------------------------------------------------
    10 ms        81.9s       100.4%
    40 ms        81.2s       101.2%
   160 ms        80.3s       102.4%
   640 ms        78.6s       104.6%
============================================================
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The latency column corresponds to various values for <b>set-min-latency</b>.
In this case, the simulation was executed with a 10 ms latency, which
means that the model predicts that the simulation would take 81.9 s
to run (which is pretty close to the measured value of 82.2 s above).
</p><p>
It is important to note that the performance model does not take
modified target behavior, due to different latency settings, into account
(which can be a huge factor if the cells interact). With substantial
inter-cell interaction, only the row corresponding to the current
latency setting should be trusted.
</p><p>
Below is an example from a more evenly loaded system run with a 
min-latency of 1 ms:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>mtprof.modelstat</b>
============================================================
  latency      rt_model  realtime/rt_model
------------------------------------------------------------
     1 ms        35.3s       107.4%
     4 ms        29.5s       128.8%
    16 ms        25.9s       146.3%
    64 ms        24.2s       156.5%
============================================================
</pre><p>
</p><p>
In this case, we see that increasing the latency setting to
about 16 ms would improve simulation performance substantially
(once again, without taking changed target behavior into account).
</p><p>

<br>
Quite often, the target behavior is not static but varies with
simulated time. In that case, it is often useful to export the
collected data and plot it using an external tool:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>mtprof.save-data output.txt</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The exported data is essentially the information provided
by <b>mtprof.cellstat</b> and/or <b>mtprof.modelstat</b>,
but expressed as a function of virtual time (exported in a plot
friendly way). The <b>mtprof.save-data</b> command takes
multiple flags which can be used to customize the
output. One useful flag is <i>-oplot</i>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>mtprof.save-data mtprof-plot.m -oplot</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
which outputs the data in the form of an Octave file together with
commands which plots the data.
</p><p>
The mtprof tool currently does not support Multicore Accelerator.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="performance-Multicore-Accelerator">16.2.2 Multicore Accelerator</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Whether to use Multicore Accelerator or not depends heavily on the
workload of the system that is being modeled. Multicore Accelerator
performs best for systems with CPU intensive tasks, with little
communication, and a low I/O rate. The <b>print-device-access-stats</b>
and <b>system-perfmeter</b> commands can be use measure the
frequency of I/O operations in the system. (I/O operations are
expensive in Multicore Accelerator mode.)
</p><p>
Note that some systems perform well even if the number of target
instructions per I/O operation is as low as 300 while others perform
bad even though this number is considerably higher. Different target
systems behave differently, and in the end, one have to benchmark each
system by itself to get highest possible performance. As a guideline,
if a target system executes less than 10,000 instructions per I/O
operation on average, one might have to consider switching off
Multicore Accelerator, or tune the system software in order to achieve
good performance.
</p><p>
The <b>enable-multicore-accelerator</b> command provides some
tuning and settings for Multicore Accelerator. For more information,
see the documentation for the <b>enable-multicore-accelerator</b>
command.
</p><p>
It is probably best practice to try to optimize the cell partitioning
as described in section <a class="reference" href="#mtprof2">16.2.1</a> to find the most resource
demanding cells first, and then switching on Multicore Accelerator for
those cells (if available host cores still exists). Currently, it is
not possible to restrict a number of host cores for particular target
CPUs. Simics will instead automatically balance the system as
efficient as possible.
