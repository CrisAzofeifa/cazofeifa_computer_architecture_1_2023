<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="revexec">12.3 Reverse Execution</a></h1>
<p>
<a name="reverse-execution"></a>
</p><p>
Simics has the capability to run a simulation in reverse, which in
many cases can greatly simplify the debugging of complicated software
problems.
</p><p>
From a user perspective, there is little difference between running
the simulation forwards and backwards; all the standard debugging
tools like breakpoints and watchpoints can be used when the simulation
is run in reverse. There are, however, some reverse execution specific
issues, which are discussed in the following sections.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-Reverse-Execution">12.3.1 Using Reverse Execution</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="bookmarks"></a>
<a name="reverse-executionbookmarks"></a>
</p><p>
Before any reverse operations can be performed, there has to be at least one
time bookmark; reverse operations are possible in the region following
the first (oldest) bookmark. Depending upon how Simics is invoked (and various
user preferences), a time bookmark denoted "start" is sometimes added
automatically at the beginning of the simulation. Bookmarks can also
be created by enabling reverse execution in an external debugger.
</p><p>
Bookmarks are managed through the commands
</p><ul>
<li><b>set-bookmark <em>label</em></b>,</li>
<li><b>list-bookmarks</b> and</li>
<li><b>delete-bookmark [<em>label</em> | -all]</b>.</li>
</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
From a performance and resource utilization perspective, it might be advantageous
to put the first bookmark as close to the region of interest as possible.
</div>Reverse execution support is disabled when all time bookmarks are deleted.
<p>
Once reverse execution has been enabled (by the creation of a time
bookmark), it is possible to both run the simulation in reverse and to
skip backwards in time. The Simics commands to do this are
</p><ul>
<li><b>reverse</b>,</li>
<li><b>reverse-to <em>position</em></b> and</li>
<li><b>skip-to <em>position</em></b>.</li>
</ul>
The <b>reverse</b> and <b>reverse-to</b> commands run the simulation backwards
until a breakpoint occurs or till the oldest time bookmark is reached. The <b>skip-to</b> command jumps to a particular point in time, ignoring intermediate breakpoints.
It should be noted that skipping can be significantly faster than reversing.
<p>
The <b>skip-to</b> and <b>reverse-to</b>
commands take either an absolute step count or a time bookmark
as argument.
</p><p>
Most forward executing commands used for debugging has
a corresponding reverse variant obtained by adding a reverse prefix.
The reverse variant of <b>step-instruction</b> is for instance
<b>reverse-step-instruction</b>.
</p><p>
Any external input (like a human typing on a virtual serial console) is
replayed when the simulation is being run forward after a reversal; this
guarantees that the simulation will follow the same path as it did originally.
For the same reason, all external input is ignored until the point is reached
where the first reverse operation was initiated. It is possible to
override this behavior with the <b>clear-recorder</b>
command. This command discards all recorded input and allows an alternate
future to take place.
</p><p>
Some changes to the simulation from entities outside the simulation
are not recorded by recorders, for example manual changes from the
command line interfaces or the graphical user interface. Such changes
can make reverse execution operate somewhat unpredictably. It is
recommended that any time bookmarks before a non-replayable change of
the simulation state is deleted explicitly.
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Performance">12.3.2 Performance</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="reverse-executionperformance"></a>
</p><p>
The usage of time bookmarks has a certain impact on overall
performance since it implicitly enables reverse execution
support. Normal performance is always obtained if all time bookmarks
are removed.
</p><p>
The reverse execution engine optimizes performance for certain reverse
operations that are expected to be common. One example of this is that
skipping to a bookmark (or to the region just after a bookmark) can be
significantly faster than skipping to some other location.
</p><p>
It is possible to tune certain reverse execution parameters in order
to optimize for a particular usage pattern (although the default
settings should work well in most situations). Trade-offs exist
between:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>reverse performance</li>
<li>forward performance</li>
<li>memory utilization</li>
<li>scope of reversibility</li>
</ul>
The <b>rexec-limit</b> command is the primary tool for adjusting the balance, e.g.
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simics&gt; <b>rexec-limit steps = 20000000 </b>
    simics&gt; <b>rexec-limit size_mb = 200 </b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The steps limit indicate that the scope of interest is at most the
specified number of steps.  By imposing a steps limit, resources can
be spent more effectively with the drawback that reversal past the
limit may not be possible.
</p><p>
The size limit imposes a limit on the amount of memory reverse
execution may use. If the limit is exceeded, reverse performance will
be traded for less memory consumption.
