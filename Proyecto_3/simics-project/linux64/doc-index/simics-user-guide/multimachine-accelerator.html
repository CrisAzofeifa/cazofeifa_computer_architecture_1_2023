The easiest way to parallelize a simulation is to use the Simics®
Multimachine Accelerator feature. It requires that
the models used in the simulation are marked as
<em>thread-safe</em>. The rest of this section describes how to use
Multimachine Accelerator.
</p><p>
With Multimachine Accelerator the simulation runs in a single Simics process:
you control the entire simulation from a single point, and the entire
simulation state gets saved in one checkpoint, just as when you run a
single threaded simulation.
</p><p>
To use Multimachine Accelerator the configuration must be partitioned into
<em><a name="simulation-cells">simulation cells</a></em>. Each cell contains a subset of
the configuration objects in the simulation. The only communication
allowed between cells is over <em><a name="link">link</a>s</em>. A link
transmits messages between objects with a <em>latency</em> measured in
simulated time, for example an Ethernet cable.
</p><p>
Dividing the system into cells can be done automatically via the
Simics's component system. This makes it easy to parallelize an existing
model.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Multithread-Ready-Models">17.1.1 Multithread-Ready Models</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="multithreadingmodels"></a>
</p><p>
Most models provided with Simics can run with Multimachine Accelerator enabled and are thus marked
<em>thread-safe</em>. Loading modules that are not marked 
<em>thread-safe</em> will result in  a warning message and
Multimachine Accelerator will be disabled. Please contact your Simics provider
if you are running a model that is not
multithread-ready and you want to utilize Multimachine Accelerator.
</p><p>
If you developed your own models of devices, you should refer to
the <em>Model Builder User's Guide</em> to learn how to make them
multithread-compatible.
</p><p>
Whenever possible, all default components provided with Simics
create <em>simulation cells</em> for use with Multimachine Accelerator. For
example, instantiating two <i>MPC8641-Simple</i> boards in
the same Simics session will create two <em>cells</em>, which can be
scheduled on two simulation threads. The maximum possible parallelism
is limited by the number of cells in a session (as well as the number
of processor cores on your host, of course). You can list the cells
instantiated in a configuration with the following command:
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>list-objects -all class = cell</b></pre><p>

</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Enabling-and-Disabling-Multimachine-Accelerator">17.1.2 Enabling and Disabling Multimachine Accelerator</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="multimachine-acceleratorenable"></a> <a name="multimachine-acceleratordisable"></a>
<a name="enable-multithreading"></a> <a name="disable-multithreading"></a>
</p><p>
Simics® Multimachine Accelerator is enabled by default. It can be turned off
using the command

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>disable-multithreading</b></pre><p>

</p><p>
and on again with
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>enable-multithreading</b></pre><p>

</p><p>
This command will also check that the configuration looks reasonable before
switching on Multimachine Accelerator, and warn you if something is incorrect. 
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="thread-sync-control">17.1.3 Controlling Cell Synchronization</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="min-latency"></a> <a name="latency"></a> <a name="multithreadinglatency"></a> 
<a name="synchronization-latency"></a>
</p><p>
To allow multi-cell simulation to perform well, Simics lets each thread run
for a certain amount of virtual time on its own before it needs to
resynchronize with the other cells. This time span is the synchronization
latency. Because of the synchronization latency, Simics does not allow
communication between objects of different cells. Even if all accesses were
properly locked and performed in a thread-safe way, the objects would have no
way to control at what time their access would be done in the other cell, and
the simulation would stop being deterministic.
</p><p>
<a name="link2"></a> 
</p><p>
The solution is to communicate via <em>link objects</em>. Link objects ensure
that messages send from one cell are delivered at the expected virtual time in
the other cell, at the cost of a virtual time delay in the transmission. For
links to send messages deterministically, the delay in transmission must be
greater or equal to the synchronization latency. For this reason, the
synchronization latency is often called the minimum latency for link
communication.
</p><p>
The next two sections explain how to control the synchronization
latency—and the link latencies—in multi-cell simulations.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="latency-simple">The Simple Way</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="domaindefault"></a> <a name="sync_domain"></a>
</p><p>
By default, Simics creates a single synchronization domain
called <b>default_sync_domain</b>. Cells created later in the simulation
will be attached to this <a name="synchronization-domain">synchronization domain</a>, unless specified
otherwise. Thus the synchronization latency in the simulation will be
controlled by the <i>min_latency</i> attribute set
in <b>default_sync_domain</b>.
</p><p>
The simplest way to control the synchronization latency is to use
the <b><a name="set-min-latency">set-min-latency</a></b> command, which will immediately
create a default synchronization domain if it does not exist, and set its
<i>min_latency</i> attribute with the given valid latency. An error
message will be printed out if the given latency value failed the validity
check.
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>set-min-latency 0.01</b>

└─────────────┴───────────────────┘


simics&gt; <b>default_sync_domain-&gt;min_latency</b>

</pre><p>
</p><p>
One important thing to remember is that the <a name="time-quantum">time quantum</a> in each
multiprocessor cell must be less than half the minimum latency. In other words:
sync_latency &gt; 2 × time_quantum for every multiprocessor cell in the
system. Simics will print an error if this condition is not respected.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Understanding-Synchronization-Domains">Understanding Synchronization Domains</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="domainhierarchy"></a>
</p><p>
Synchronization latencies can be controlled in a much finer
way. Synchronization domains can be organized in a hierarchy that allows
different cells to be synchronized with different latencies. This organization
is the foundation of the domain-based distribution system, described in
chapter <a class="reference" href="distributed-simulation.html">17.3</a>.
</p><p>
Let us build a networked system with two-tightly coupled machines communicating
on a very fast network, associated with a control server that sends a command
from time to time. The two machines require a low communication latency, while
the communication latency between them and the server does not matter. Using a
hierarchy of two domains allows all latency requirements to be fulfilled
without sacrificing performance:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Top-domain (latency 1.0s)
 -&gt; Server cell
 -&gt; Sub-domain (latency 1e-6s)
     -&gt; Machine0 cell
     -&gt; Machine1 cell
</pre><p>
</p><p>
In that configuration, the two machines can communicate with a latency
of 1e-6&nbsp;s while the communication latency between the machines
and the server is 1&nbsp;s. In practice, this allows Simics to give
the server a 1&nbsp;s synchronization window with the two machines,
hence much less synchronization overhead and a better usage of parallel
simulation.
</p><p>
More concretely, in Simics, the domains are setup in the following way (in
Python):
</p><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">@top_domain = pre_conf_object("top_domain", "sync_domain")
@top_domain.min_latency = 1.0

@sub_domain = pre_conf_object("sub_domain", "sync_domain")
@sub_domain.min_latency = 1e-6
@sub_domain.sync_domain = top_domain

@SIM_add_configuration([top_domain, sub_domain], None)
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Cells created automatically can be assigned to a domain by using
the <i>domain</i> attribute of the corresponding top-component. It is
also possible to set a cell's <i>sync_domain</i> attribute when
creating it manually.
</p><p>

</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Setting-Latencies-the-Complete-Rules">Setting Latencies: the Complete Rules</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="min-latency2"></a>
</p><p>
Latencies must obey certain rules for the domain hierarchy to work properly:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>The <a name="time-quantum2">time quantum</a> of a multiprocessor cell must be less than half
the <a name="latency2">latency</a> of the domain that contains the cell. The reason for
this restriction is that the synchronization system considers a cell as a
single unit and does not cope with the fact that the processors inside the cell
are scheduled in a round-robin fashion. Simics checks this requirement and
prints an error message if a domain latency is incompatible with a cell time
quantum.</li>

<li>The latency of a child domain must be less than half the latency of its
parent domain. This restriction is once again related to how synchronization
events are scheduled. Simics checks for this requirement and adjusts the
latency of the child domain automatically while printing a warning.</li>

<li>The latency of a domain must be greater than the length of two cycles of
the slowest processor it contains. Simics uses cycles as lowest time unit for
posting events, so synchronization can not be ensured if the latency resolution
is too small. Simics checks this requirement and prints an error message if a
domain latency is incompatible with one of the processor.</li>

<li>A link may not have a latency smaller than the one of the lowest domain in
the hierarchy that contains the cells the link is connected in. In other words:
the link must obey the highest latency between the systems it is connected
to. Simics checks this requirement and adjust the link latency automatically
upward if necessary while printing a warning.</li>

<li>Once set, latencies may not be changed. This is a limitation in Simics that
we hope to remove in future versions.</li>

</ul>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Multimachine-Accelerator-and-Scripting">17.1.4 Multimachine Accelerator and Scripting</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Commands and script branches are never run multithreaded, thus parallelism can
be safely ignored most of the time when scripting Simics. However,
using Simics® Multimachine Accelerator has side-effects that may cause
scripts to behave
in a correct but indeterministic way. If we consider the following script, in a
configuration consisting of two cells, <b>cell0</b> and <b>cell1</b>:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">cell0_console.break "foo"
c
cell1_console.input "bar"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Even with <b>cell0</b> and <b>cell1</b> running in parallel, the
simulation will stop properly when the text breakpoint in <b>cell0</b> is
triggered. However, <b>cell1</b> is not at a deterministic point in time:
the only thing known about it is that it is within a certain window of virtual
time in which it is allowed to drift without needing to re-synchronize
with <b>cell0</b>, as explained in the previous section. So running this
script twice in a row may not produce exactly the same results.
</p><p>
In many cases, it does not matter and the scripts will work fine. If perfect
determinism is required, it is possible to save a checkpoint and run the
sensitive part of the simulation single-threaded.
</p><p>
One aspect of Multimachine Accelerator that affects scripting directly is Python
scripting. Hap handlers are run in the thread where they are triggered, which
means that the same handler can run in parallel on different host
processors. If the handler uses global state, it must use proper locks to
access it. In general, this is not a problem since most haps are triggered for
a specific object, so their handlers will only run in the thread where this
object is scheduled. Some haps are triggered globally, however, and care must
be taken when responding to them.
</p><p>
Python scripts are run with the global Python lock taken, so Python scripts
never <em>really</em> run in parallel. However, the Python interpreter will
schedule Python threads as it sees fit, so Python code that may run in several
threads (device or extension code, hap handlers) should not assume that it has
full control of the execution. The Python lock is also released every time a
Simics API functions is called (including implicit calls like reading an
attribute value).
</p><p>
When running Python scripts in a simulation thread, the script should not
access state that is in a different cell, since this cell might be running on
another host processor. When in need to access the whole simulation state, a
callback function can be scheduled with <b><i>SIM_run_alone()</i></b> (this is
currently how script branches and commands are handled).
</p><p>
Finally, running commands in the simulation thread is <em>not</em> allowed, as
the CLI parser is not thread-safe and might cause unexpected problems. Commands
must be scheduled with <b><i>SIM_run_alone()</i></b>. It is also possible to
rewrite scripts to access directly objects and attributes instead of using the
commands directly.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="accelerator-mt">17.1.5 Dynamic Load Balancing</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics uses <a name="dynamic-load-balancing">dynamic load balancing</a> to distribute the
simulation workload across the available hardware resources (host
threads). The dynamic load balancer optimizes the mapping of
simulation threads onto available host resources.
</p><p>
When Simics is running with Simics® Multimachine Accelerator, CPUs belonging
to the same cell can not be simulated concurrently by separate host
threads. The available concurrency in this mode of operation is
between CPUs belonging to different cells. Using as many cells as
possible can potentially improve performance since this increases the
parallelism of the simulation. Having many cells also makes it easier
for the dynamic load balancer to keep all host threads fully loaded.
</p><p>
When Simics is running with Multicore Accelerator, CPUs belonging to
the same cell can be simulated concurrently. Note that Multimachine
Accelerator is implied by Multicore Accelerator.
</p><p>
Simics uses a non hierarchical scheduling algorithm based on simulated
time and available work. By default, Simics spawns at most as many
threads as there are host threads, but it is possible to limit this
number using the <b>set-thread-limit</b> command. Setting a thread
limit may be useful if the physical machine is shared by multiple
users.
</p><p>
Simics does not interact with the host operating system with regards
to scheduling. The details of the scheduling are internal and there
exists no API for controlling it.
