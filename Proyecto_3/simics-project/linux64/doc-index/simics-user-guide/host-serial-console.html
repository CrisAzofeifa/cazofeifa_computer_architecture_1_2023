The text consoles also have the ability to open host serial
connections. This is a way of connecting a terminal application
through a serial port on the host machine to a serial device object in
Simics. The procedure is almost identical in both Linux and
Windows. The following examples show how to open host serial
connections on a <i>QSP-x86</i> machine, first in Linux:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">
simics&gt; <b>board.serconsole.con.host-serial-setup pty = /dev/pts/1</b>
[board.serconsole.con info] Device opened: /dev/pts/1

</pre><p>
</p><p>
And the same procedure in Windows:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">
simics&gt; <b>board.serconsole.con.host-serial-setup pty = COM1</b>
[board.serconsole.con info] Opened: COM1

</pre><p>
</p><p>
The host serial connection will operate at the baud rate and other attributes
that are set for the physical serial port of the host. In Linux these host
settings are edited with <b>stty</b>. In Windows these settings
must be edited from a <b>Command Prompt</b>, this is an example:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">
C:\&gt; <b>mode com1: baud=4800 parity=n data=8 stop=1</b>

</pre><p>
</p><p>
It is also possible to open a host serial connection to a virtual
serial port. In Linux this is called pseudo-terminal or
pseudo-device. If there is no parameter specified
to <b>host-serial-setup</b>, any free <code>pts</code> is opened.
</p><p>
However, in Windows a virtual serial port must have been created in
advance.  There exist several Windows third-party utilities which
create virtual serial port pairs for various purposes. In the
following example, first such a pair has been created with the port
names COM98 and COM99, then a host serial connection can be opened to
port 98, and finally the terminal application can connect to port 99
and the two can communicate over the pair:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">
simics&gt; <b>board.serconsole.con.host-serial-setup pty = COM98</b>
[board.serconsole.con info] Opened: COM98

</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Using-host-serial-connections-with-Windows-HyperTerminal">8.2.1 Using host serial connections with Windows HyperTerminal</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Once the host serial connection has been configured within Simics it is
possible to connect to it using a standard terminal program running
on your host system. In this section we will use the <a name="HyperTerminal">HyperTerminal</a>
application, which comes bundled with some Windows versions, to connect to the
simulated system.
</p><p>
First launch HyperTerminal from
<b>Start Menu → All Programs → Accessories →
Communications → HyperTerminal</b>.
The dialog <i>Connection Description</i> will appear, as shown in Figure
<a class="reference" href="#host-serial-hyperterminal-setup">2</a>. Name the Connection "Simics"
and press <i>OK</i>. In the next dialog, select the COM-port that Simics
has opened in the field <i>Connect using</i>.
In the next dialog, just accept the default settings and press <i>OK</i>.

Now, resume the simulation in Simics. The output from the simulated serial
console will appear in the HyperTerminal window. See figure
