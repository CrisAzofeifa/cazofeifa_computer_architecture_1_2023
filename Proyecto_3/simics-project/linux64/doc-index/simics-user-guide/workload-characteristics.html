The performance of Simics
sometimes depends on the kind of software that runs inside the target
machine being simulated. Thus, the slowdown can vary a lot depending
on what the target software is currently executing.  Here are some
general tips for understanding what decreases simulation speed.
</p><dl><dt id="dt:floating-point-intense-workloads"><b>Floating-point intense workloads</b></dt><dd>If the target software runs
floating-point arithmetic instructions frequently, the performance is likely
lower compared to running integer based workloads. The same is usually true
for workloads with frequent use of SIMD-style media instructions.</dd><dt id="dt:supervisor-code"><b>Supervisor code</b></dt><dd>If a workload runs much of the code in supervisor mode
such as frequently causing exceptions, this type of code normally runs slower
than regular user-level code.</dd><dt id="dt:i-o-workloads"><b>I/O workloads</b></dt><dd>If the code does frequent accesses to devices,
compared to accessing RAM, Simics needs to do more work to simulate this, which
slows down simulation. Note that this type of workload is an excellent candidate
for a lower IPC setting.</dd><dt id="dt:memory-usage"><b>Memory usage</b></dt><dd>If the target software is using more memory than available on the host.
This is typically a problem when the simulated machine has equal or more
memory than the host it executes on <b>and</b> the software also uses it.
This will cause Simics to swap out pages on disk, which decreases performance.</dd><dt id="dt:event-usage"><b>Event usage</b></dt><dd>Simics modules which frequently post events with short time quanta.
For example, if a device posts an event every 10th cycle, to keep a counter
register updated, this will severely affect performance.</dd></dl><p>Typically, target code which runs with low performance on real hardware due
to bad cache behavior, bad memory locality etc. will also cause Simics to run
with poor performance.

<p>

<a name="hypersimulation"></a>
</p><p>
When an operating system does not have any processes to schedule,
it typically runs some tight loop waiting for an interrupt to occur.
This is referred to as the <i>idle loop</i>. The way the idle loop is
implemented varies between operating systems and the capabilities
in the underlying hardware.
</p><p>
For example, the most simple idle loop would be a "branch to itself"
instruction. When the processor reaches this instruction, nothing
but an interrupt will cause the execution to proceed somewhere else.
Another example is when the operating system uses some kind of
power-down mode on the processor, causing the processor to stop
executing any more instructions (and consequently consume less power).
Some processors also have dedicated instructions causing the
processor to stop until something interesting happens, such as the
x86 <code>HLT</code> instruction.
Processor idling in Simics is defined by what the simulator can detect and
usually includes architectural states such as halt or power-down,
but can also be loops normally executed by the processor.
</p><p>
A fast simulation of the idle loop, is very important in some cases.
For example, when simulating multiple processors, we want to use as
much of the host CPU cycles as possible for simulating the processor
that actually performs useful tasks. Rather than wasting cycles on
the idle loop.
</p><p>
Even when simulating a single CPU, fast idle loops can be important,
since all of the active processes might be stalling on disk or some
other peripheral. Execution of the processes will not continue unless,
for example, a disk issues an interrupt.
</p><p>
Simics processor models can sometimes detect idle conditions.
When the processor model detects a branch to itself, there is no point
in simulating the instruction, if it branches to itself repeatedly.
</p><p>
Instead, Simics is capable of fast-forwarding time until an event that
can generate an interrupt is about to be executed. Hence, this model
is equivalent to running the branch millions of times, but is much faster.
</p><p>
In some cases, the idle loop in the operating system is more than a
single instruction, e.g., it might be a loop checking a variable in memory
for the next process to schedule. These more
difficult cases can be handled with hypersimulation (see chapter
<a class="reference" href="hypersimulation.html">16.5</a>).
