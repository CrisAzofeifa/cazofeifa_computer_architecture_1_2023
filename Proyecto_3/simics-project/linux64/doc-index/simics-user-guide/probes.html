  This section describes the <em>Probes Framework</em> in Simics.
    </p><p>
  Simics' Probes framework provides a generic mechanism for measuring
  counters and other statistics in Simics. The probe measurement points
  are distributed across the entire simulated system.
</p><p>
  Probes can be related to target processors, device models, the host
  system (where Simics runs), instrumentation tools etc. There are also
  probes which presents sums of other probes in the system on cell or
  global level.
</p><p>
  Currently, most probes have been added for the purpose of measuring
  and understanding the performance of Simics. Additional probes could
  focus more on the target hardware and software aspects.
</p><p>
  A probe offers a simple way to extract the value, and also contains
  type information and formatting hints on the probe itself to present
  the value of the probe, in an uniform and user-readable format.
  </p><p>
  A probe is identified by a probe name, which is a string with a
  hierarchical namespaces separated with dots (<code>.</code>). For
  example, <code>cpu.cycles</code> would be found in each processor model
  in the system and represents how many cycles that has elapsed on the
  specific processor. The <code>cell.cycles</code> probes are related to the
  cell objects and this returns the sum of executed cycles of
  processors which located under the specific cell.
  Finally, <code>sim.cycles</code> is not related to any object but form a
  singelton sum of all the processor's cycles elapsed.
</p><p>
  Probes can also be derived from other probes, offering a some
  calculated metric. For example <code>sim.slowdown</code> is calculated
  as the fraction between <code>sim.time.virtual</code>
  and <code>sim.time.wallclock</code>, providing an indication how fast
  the virtual time elapsed compared to the real wallclock time on the
  system which Simics runs on.
  </p><p>
  Simics itself is aware of all probes that currently exist
  in the system, allowing commands to list the probes or read out
  their values from Simics command line interface.
</p><p>
  Probes may either be explicitly implemented in the various
  Simics objects, or can implicitly created by the probes
  framework itself. For example, Simics may detect that a new
  object is created which implement the <code>cycle</code> interface
  and then automatically create probes for accessing their
  cycle information.
