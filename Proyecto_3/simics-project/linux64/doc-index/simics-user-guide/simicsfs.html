<p>

<a name="SimicsFS"></a>
</p><p>
SimicsFS with FUSE is a new implementation based on FUSE, Filesystem in
Userspace, which is supported by most Linux systems[1]. This is a client-server
solution, which is more feature complete and with better performance than the
old SimicsFS kernel module and device solution.
</p><p>
The Simics extension, SimicsFS with FUSE, will grant a simulated Linux system
access to the file system of the host computer from inside the simulation. This
allows more storage space for the target system and may make copying files to
and from the target system unnecessary as they can be accessed directly from the
host file system.
</p><p>
The SimicsFS client, used for SimicsFS with FUSE, is a regular Linux user-space
application that allows non-privileged users to mount and unmount file systems.
The FUSE kernel module needs to be included in the Linux kernel and the libfuse
userspace library[2] in the Linux distribution.
</p><p>
All accesses to the host filesystem will be made with the privileges of the user
starting the Simics session.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
[1] FUSE is compatible with all Linux kernels since version 2.4.
  [2] SimicsFS client is compatible with FUSE 2.6 or later.
</div>Some characteristics/limitations for SimicsFS with FUSE:
<p>
</p><ul>
  <li>The user can only mount on a mountpoint, for which the user has write
    permission.</li>
  <li>The mountpoint is owned by the user.</li>
  <li>No other user (including root) can access the contents of the mounted file
    system (although this can be relaxed by using the allow_other and allow_root
    mount options).</li>
  <li>All file system operations on the host are performed by the user running
    Simics, indifferent to which user requested the operations in the target
    system. Therefore even a super user on the target is constrained by the
    file system permissions of the user running Simics.</li>
  <li>SimicsFS does not perform any character set transformation of characters
    in the file paths, so if different character sets are used on the
    simulated target and on the host, the characters may be interpreted
    differently.</li>
  <li>SimicsFS is currently not using wide characters on Windows, and valid file
    path names are therefore limited to ASCII characters.</li>
  <li>Read-only files on the target system may not be copied to the mounted
    file system. See workaround in section <a class="reference" href="#simicsfs-fuse-using">7.5.2</a>.
  </li>
  <li>On Windows, the SimicsFS client only has partial access to the actual
    permissions of files and directories. Some permissions are not correctly
    reported, nor configurable by the client. See table below.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
  
  The SimicsFS client is installed on some disk images distributed with Simics.
  Where there is also a <code>/host</code> directory and definitions in
  <code>/etc/fstab</code> for mounting SimicsFS with the command
  <code>mount /host</code> by root. Then the host files become accessible by root
  alone.
</p><p>
  If you run your own Linux distribution you have to compile SimicsFS client
  yourself. The source code is located in the
  <code>src/misc/simicsfs-client/</code> directory and in the
  <code>src/misc/libmagicpipe/</code> directory of the Base package (pkg 1000).
  The Linux kernel must be compiled with FUSE support and the file system must
  include libfuse.
</p><p>
  Example definition in the <code>/etc/fstab</code> for mounting SimicsFS with
  the command <code>mount /host</code> by root:
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    <b>simicsfs-client      /host      fuse     defaults,noauto       0 0</b>
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  Replace <code>/host</code> with your mount point. The simicsfs-client
  executable must be located in a directory included in the PATH environment
  variable, either by placing it there or adding its directory.
</p><p>
  With the user option it is also possible to define entries in
  <code>/etc/fstab</code> for normal users to mount and unmount SimicsFS.
  Example showing mount of host user home directory on directory
  <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code>:
</p><p>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    <b>simicsfs-client  &lt;dir&gt;  fuse  <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
defaults,noauto,user,modules=subdir,subdir=/home/&lt;user&gt;  0 0</b>
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  The <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code> directory must be empty and have write
  permission for the user. The user mounts with the command
  <code>mount &lt;dir&gt;</code> and unmounts with the command
  <code>fusermount -u &lt;dir&gt;</code>.
</p><p>
  See the fstab and fuse documentation ("man fstab", "man fuse") for more
  information about the available mount options.

  The SimicsFS client requires the SimicsFS server to be started:
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small"> simics&gt; <b>start-simicsfs-server</b></pre><p>
</p><p>
  Example commands showing how to mount SimicsFS with the command
  <code>simicsfs-client</code>:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Mount host root directory on directory <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code>:
      <pre class="jdocu_small">~:$ <b>simicsfs-client &lt;dir&gt;</b></pre><p></p></li>
    <li>Mount host user home directory on directory <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code>:
      <pre class="jdocu_small">	~:$ <b>simicsfs-client &lt;dir&gt; -omodules=subdir,subdir=/home/&lt;user&gt;</b>
    </pre><p></p></li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Example command showing how to unmount SimicsFS:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Unmount SimicsFS on directory <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code>:
      <pre class="jdocu_small">~:$ <b>fusermount -u &lt;dir&gt;</b></pre><p></p></li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Example commands showing how to mount SimicsFS on <code>/host</code>
  directory by root with definition in <code>/etc/fstab</code>, see section
  <a class="reference" href="#simicsfs-fuse-install">7.5.1</a>:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Mount host root directory on <code>/host</code>:
      <pre class="jdocu_small">~:$ <b>mount /host</b></pre><p></p></li>
    <li>Mount host user home directory on <code>/host</code>:
      <pre class="jdocu_small">	~:$ <b>mount /host -omodules=subdir,subdir=/home/&lt;user&gt;</b>
    </pre><p></p></li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Example command showing how to mount SimicsFS on <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code>
  directory by a normal user:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Mount host user home directory on <code>&lt;dir&gt;</code>. A user
      can not add options to the mount command so the options are added in
      <code>/etc/fstab</code>, see section <a class="reference" href="#simicsfs-fuse-install">7.5.1</a>.
      <pre class="jdocu_small">~:$ <b>mount &lt;dir&gt;</b></pre><p></p></li>
  </ul>
<p>
  </p><div class="note">
<b>Workaround for copying read-only files:</b>
Read-only files on the
    target system may not be copied to the mounted file system. A workaround
    is to first touch the file in the mounted file system, which creates the
    file with write permission, and then copy the file from the target system to
    the mounted file system. Finally change permission of the destination file
    to read-only.
  </div><div class="note">
<b>Tip:</b>
When running Simics on Windows host, replace all '\' in the
    mount path with '/' to prevent interpretation of escape character by the
    simulated target software. Example:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">~:$ <b>simicsfs-client dir -omodules=subdir,subdir=D:/home/&lt;user&gt;</b></pre><p>
  </p></div>
<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="simicsfs-path-subst">7.5.3 SimicsFS Path Substitution</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  The host directory mounted from a target system is the root directory by
  default, but that is configurable from the target system. Although, it may not
  be feasible or desirable to modify the target system configuration when the
  host system path changes. The path may also be part of a checkpoint and may
  not be applicable when the checkpoint is restored again. For these cases the
  host path can be substituted with a replacement path on the host.
</p><p>
  To perform a substitution a path rule must be created. These are applied to
  every operation, with immediate effect. A rule can be general to all clients
  or specific to just a group of clients. The rule will look for a substring in
  the requested path and replace that substring with the new destination path.
  The substring matching is performed from the beginning of the path, but need
  not match the whole requested path in the mount command on the target.
</p><p>
  A client may thus request an existing or non-existing path on the host. This
  path will be matched against the defined path rules to see if there is a
  match. Specific rules are checked first, then the general rules. Therefore a
  specific rule will always override a general one. Otherwise the rules are
  matched in the order they were added and only the first matching rule will be
  applied.
</p><p>
  <br><b>EXAMPLES:</b><br>
</p><p>
  One of the main use-cases for this feature is to allow access to a user
  defined path which is configured at run-time without the need to modify the
  target configuration. For instance the users may want to access their own home
  directories, without modifying the generic target image. For this purpose they
  define a mount-point <code>/mnt/home</code> which is configured to
  mount <code>/home/user</code> on the host. The host path
  <code>/home/user</code> may not exist on the host and requires the user to
  configure a path rule to substitute it for the real home directory of the
  current user.
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simics&gt; <b>$userhome = (env HOME)</b>
    simics&gt; <b>&lt;simicsfs-server&gt;.add-path-rule /home/user $userhome</b>
    ~:$ <b>mount -t simicsfs-client /mnt/home -osubdir,subdir=/home/user</b>
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  Another major use-case for this feature is to solve the checkpoint problem,
  where a user has mounted some path on the local machine. This checkpoint is
  then shared with a colleague, who has similar files stored in another path.
  The colleague will then need to replace the requested host path with the
  actual path to the equivalent folder local to this other machine.
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simics&gt; <b>&lt;simicsfs-server&gt;.add-path-rule /work/simics/proj /my/path/to/proj</b>
  </pre><p>
</p><p>
  Sometimes you may need to differentiate between different clients. When a
  client registers itself with the simicsfs server, it provides a bit of details
  on the target that it runs on. Each of these details can be used to select
  clients for different groups. These groups can then be given as an extra
  argument to the path rule, which will then only apply to the clients of that
  group. Once a client is registered, it is assigned a unique magic number.
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simics&gt; <b>&lt;simicsfs-server&gt;.add-client-group a_team magic 0x0103a1245edb31da</b>
    simics&gt; <b>&lt;simicsfs-server&gt;.add-path-rule "/" /proj/area_a a_team</b>
  </pre><p>
  The first line will create a group called <code>a_team</code> which will consist
  of the client with magic number <code>0x0103a1245edb31da</code>. Since the magic
  numbers are unique there can only be one client in this group. The second
  line will add a path rule that replaces the root directory with
  <code>/proj/area_a</code>, but only for clients that belong to group
  <code>a_team</code>.
  </p><div class="note">
<b>Path rule limitation:</b>
The simicsfs-client is not aware of any changes to the path rules, which
    means that recently accessed files may appear to still be present even
    though the path rule has changed to point to another destination. Operations
    on that file, however, will fail.
