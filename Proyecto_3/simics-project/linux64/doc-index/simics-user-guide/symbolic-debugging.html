A vital part of a debugger's task is to understand the system being
debugged at a higher level than just machine instructions and memory
contents. The user thinks in terms of processes, functions, and named
variables, so the debugger presents a view of the software that
matches these concepts. This view is even more important in Simics,
where the user has access to the whole system and not only user
processes. To handle this, Simics Analyzer provides a full symbolic
debugger, which you can read about in <em>Simics Analyzer User's
Guide</em>.
</p><p>
Simics provides only some primitive building blocks for basic
debugging like <em><a name="context">context</a> objects</em>.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Contexts">12.2.1 Contexts</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
A <b>context</b> object represents a virtual address
space. Each processor in the simulated system has a <em><a name="currentcontext">current
context</a></em><a name="contextcurrent"></a>, which represents the
virtual address space currently visible to code running on the
processor. Virtual-address breakpoints are properties of contexts;
different context objects have separate sets of virtual breakpoints,
and by changing a processor's current context, you change its set of
virtual breakpoints.
</p><p>
The correctness of the simulation does not depend on contexts in any
way; the concept of multiple virtual address spaces is useful for
<em>understanding</em> the simulated software, but not necessary for
running it. What contexts to create and how to use them is
entirely your business; Simics does not care.
</p><p>
By default, every processor in a simulation cell use the same default
context. You may create new contexts and switch between them at any
time. This allows you, for example, to maintain separate debugging
symbols and breakpoints for different processes in your target
machine. When a context is used in this manner (active when and only
when a certain simulated process is active), the context is said
to <em>follow</em><a name="processfollow"></a> the process.
</p><p>
<em>Simics Analyzer</em> will help you coordinate
contexts for processes running on the target system.
