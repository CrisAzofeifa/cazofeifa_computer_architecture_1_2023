</p><p>
Many Simics commands will look up files based on the current
directory. When Simics is launched from the command line, the current
directory is the current directory of the shell Simics was launched
from. When Simics is launched by double clicking its icon, the current
directory is the project
directory. This may be impractical when writing scripts or building
new configurations, so Simics provides two features to ease directory
handling:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>Simics recognizes some special path markers that are translated before
being used:
<p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:simics"><b><code>%simics%</code></b></dt><dd>This path marker causes Simics to
locate the file (following the marker) in the project directory or in any of
the installed packages. If not found in the project directory, Simics will
start searching in the newest package, i.e. the one with the highest build-id
number.
<p>
For example, <code>%simics%/scripts/foo.simics</code> could be translated to:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:windows"><b>Windows:</b></dt><dd><code>C:\Program
    Files\Simics\Simics 6\Simics
    6.0.1\scripts\foo.simics</code></dd><dt id="dt:linux"><b>Linux:</b></dt><dd><code>
    /opt/simics/simics-6/simics-6.0.1/scripts/foo.simics
    </code></dd></dl><p>Note that if you change the version of Simics,
<code>%simics%</code> will change as well, so you should use it to refer only
to files that you know are present in all Simics versions. Notice also that
<code>%simics%</code> has no meaning if no file can be found. You can use the
command <b>lookup-file</b> to find out how the path will be
translated.</p></dd><dt id="dt:script"><b><code>%script%</code></b></dt><dd>Translated to the directory where the
currently running script is located. A possible usage is to let a script call
another one in the same directory, independently of what the current directory
is.
<p>
For example, if the directory <code>baz</code> contains the scripts
<nobr><code>foo.simics</code></nobr> and <nobr><code>bar.simics</code></nobr>,
even if the user uses
Simics with another current directory, it will be possible for
<code>foo.simics</code> to call <code>bar.simics</code> by issuing the command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">run-command-file %script%/bar.simics</pre><p></p></dd></dl><p><code>%simics%</code> and <code>%script%</code> are always translated to
absolute paths, so they never interact with the next feature, called
<em>Simics's search path</em>. One consequence is that they must
always be used in double
quotes <code>"%simics%/targets/qsp-x86/images"</code> to ensure
that escaped characters such as spaces are used correctly.</p></li>

<li>Simics has a list of paths called <em>Simics's search path</em> where files
will be looked up when using some specific commands (among others,
<b>load-binary</b>, <b>load-file</b>, <b>run-command-file</b>, and
<b>run-python-file</b>) and a number of classes (such as the
<b>image</b> class and the tftp server implementation in the
<b>service-node</b>). The file is first looked up in the current
directory, then in all entries of Simics's search path, in order.
<p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:windows-2"><b>Windows:</b></dt><dd>Let us assume for example that Simics's search path contains<br>
<code>C:\Users\joe\scripts\</code><br>
and that the current directory is<br>
<code>C:\Users\joe\project\</code><br>
If the command:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>run-command-file test/start-test.simics</b></pre><p>
</p><p>
is issued, Simics will look for the following files to run:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><code>C:\Users\joe\project\test\start-test.simics</code></li>
<li><code>C:\Users\joe\scripts\test\start-test.simics</code></li>
</ol>
</dd><dt id="dt:linux-2"><b>Linux:</b></dt><dd>Let us assume for example that Simics's search path contains<br>
<code>/home/joe/scripts/</code> and that the current directory is
<code>/home/joe/project</code>. If the command:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>run-command-file test/start-test.simics</b></pre><p>
</p><p>
is issued, Simics will look for the following files to run:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li><code>/home/joe/project/test/start-test.simics</code></li>
<li><code>/home/joe/scripts/test/start-test.simics</code></li>
</ol>
</dd></dl><p></p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Simics's search path can be manipulated using the <b>add-directory</b>,
<b>clear-directories</b> and <b>list-directories</b> commands. Simics's
search path is also used when looking for image files belonging to checkpoints
or new configurations. This is described in section <a href="checkpointing.html#checkpoint-path">Image Search Path</a>.
</p><p>
Remember that setting a CLI variable to a path with %simics% or %script% does
not in itself evaluate the path marker. This means that the path marker may
evaluate to another directory than is anticipated.
The following two lines evaluate quite differently:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">$just_a_string = "%script%/images/my_image"
$absolute_path = (lookup-file "%script%/images/my_image")
</pre><p>
The first CLI variable reads the given text and may evaluate to wherever.
The second variable is evaluated locally and reads the absolute path for the
<code>my_image</code> file that is located nearby the script.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Although the Simics search path is saved in the <code>sim</code> object in
checkpoints, allowing image files that were found through it to be opened again
by the checkpoint, it is not available until the object creation phase. Module
initialization code should not rely on the Simics path since that code is run
before the <code>sim</code> object from the checkpoint has been created.
