<p>

Script branches allow the user to write sequences of CLI commands that can be
postponed, waiting for things to happen in the simulator, without breaking the
sequential flow of commands.
This is typically used to avoid breaking a script into many small sections,
each run as a callback using Python.
</p><p>
A simple example of a script branch:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">script-branch "script branch description (optional)" {
    echo "This is a script branch test - going to sleep."
    board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].wait-for-step 10
    echo "Processor registers after 10 steps:"
    board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].print-processor-registers
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The example above will execute the first <b>echo</b> command at once, and
then go to sleep waiting until the first 10 instructions (steps) have run.
When the step counter for the processor has reached 10, the branch will wake
up and run the next two commands, <b>echo</b> and
<b>print-processor-registers</b>.
</p><p>
A big difference between script branches and the main script is that the main
script (also called main branch) may be interrupted by the user pressing the
stop button or typing Ctrl-C. The script branches are unaffected by such
actions and can exist in the background, coexisting with any interactive
command line use.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="How-Script-Branches-Work">5.2.2 How Script Branches Work</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
<a name="script-branchwait-for"></a>
When a script branch is started (using <b>script-branch</b>), it begins
executing immediately, and runs until a <b>wait-for-</b>, command is
issued. Execution is then resumed in the main script; i.e., there is never any
concurrent activity. When some activity occurs that a script branch is waiting
for, the branch continues executing once the currently simulated instruction
is ready.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Since only one branch can be active at once, any callback to Python from
Simics will execute in the currently active branch, i.e., if a branch installs
a callback, it is most likely that it will be called when the main branch is
active.</div>

<p><a name="variable"></a>
<a name="CLIlocal-variable"></a>
<a name="script-branchlocal-variable"></a>
Variable references in CLI are evaluated when accessed. This is important to
remember when writing script branches, since some commands are executed when
the branch has been suspended, and variables may have been changed. To make
sure that CLI variables in script branches are untouched by other scripts,
they should be made local.
</p><p>
The following example
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">script-branch "sample script branch" {
    $foo = 20
    board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].wait-for-step 10
    echo "foo is " + $foo
}
$foo = 15
run
</pre><p>
will produce the output <code>foo is 15</code> while the following script will
print <code>foo is 20</code>.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">script-branch "sample script branch" {
    local $foo = 20
    board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].wait-for-step 10
    echo "foo is " + $foo
}
$foo = 15
run
</pre><p>
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Script-Branches-and-Reverse-Execution">5.2.5 Script Branches and Reverse Execution</a></h2>
<p>

The script environment is used to control the simulated system and is not
reversed itself when the simulation runs backwards. As a result, it is possible
to write scripts that run the simulation both forward and backwards.
</p><p>
By default, the <b>wait-for-</b> script branch commands only wait for
events to happen when the simulation is running forward and silently ignore
them when reversing. The <i>-reverse</i> and <i>-always</i> flags,
provided by most <b>wait-for-</b> commands, can be used to wait for events
occurring in only the reverse direction or in both.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Script-Branches-and-Multi-Threaded-Simulation">5.2.6 Script Branches and Multi-Threaded Simulation</a></h2>
<p>

Large system configurations can be split up over several <em>cells</em> where
each cell runs in its own host thread to speed up simulation. Care must be
taken when writing scripts in such sessions. If the simulation is stopped or
paused, for example by a breakpoint, other cells than the one where the
breakpoint occurred may be ahead or behind in simulated time. The difference
in time between cells is limited by the minimum latency setting. The time where
cells are stopped may also differ between runs of the same setup. To ensure
deterministic behavior, a script stopping a simulation as result of some event
should only access the cell where the event occurred. If the script needs to
access the full configuration, i.e. also objects in other cells, then all cells
have to be synchronized in time. The <b>wait-for-global-time</b> and
<b>wait-for-global-sync</b> commands can be used to run until a point where
all cells have synchronized.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Canceling-Script-Branches">5.2.7 Canceling Script Branches</a></h2>
<p>

It is possible to cancel a suspended script branch by interrupting it using the
<b>interrupt-script-branch</b> command. Each branch has an ID associated
that can be found using <b>list-script-branches</b>, and that is returned
by the <b>script-branch</b> command.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">$id = (script-branch "sample script branch" {
    wait-for-breakpoint $bp
})

...

simics&gt; <b>interrupt-script-branch $id</b>
Command 'wait-for-breakpoint' interrupted.
Script branch 1 interrupted.
</pre><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Script-Branch-Restrictions">5.2.8 Script Branch Restrictions</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
There are a few things related to script branches that are discouraged or not
allowed:
</p><ul>

<li>
  Starting and stopping the simulation should be avoided from script branches
  that run in sessions with interactive use, such as target start scripts. It
  is only in batch mode that controlling the simulation from script branches
  is acceptable, but then care should be taken to avoid script branches that
  conflict with each other.
</li>

<li>
  A script branch may not define a new script branch nested inside itself.
</li>

<li>
  The <b>wait-for-</b> command can not run in the main branch. The
  reason is that the main branch may be interrupted by the user pressing the
  stop button or Ctrl-C, while script branches and the <b>wait-for-</b>
  commands are unaffected by such actions.
</li>

<li>
  The <b>write-configuration</b> command cannot be run while Simics is
  executing. This is a limitation that will be removed in a future Simics
  version, but for now the execution has to be stopped first. The following is
  an example that writes a checkpoint when the simulation reaches a login
  prompt, and then continues running. It assumes that a text-console called
  <code>text_console_cmp0.con</code> is used.
<p>
  <a name="wait-for-string"></a>
  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">script-branch "create checkpoint" {
    board.console.con.bp-wait-for-string login
    stop
    write-configuration login.conf
    run
}
  </pre><p>
  This is one of few exceptions to the rule that script branches should not
  start or stop the simulation.
  </p></li>

</ul>
