<p>
<a name="breakpoint"></a>
</p><p>
Simics can set breakpoints on code and data. Unlike most debuggers,
Simics breakpoints are not limited by what the hardware can support;
for example, there is no restriction on the number of read/write
breakpoints (also known as watchpoints).
</p><p>
In Simics you can set breakpoints on, for instance:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

    <li>memory accesses: any range and combination of
    read/write/execute</li>

    <li>time (number of cycles or instructions executed)</li>

    <li>instruction types, such as control register accesses</li>

    <li>device accesses</li>

    <li>output in the console</li>

    <li>log output</li>
</ul>
<p>
Simics is fully deterministic, and breakpoints in Simics are fully
non-intrusive. This makes it possible to narrow down the location of
difficult bugs by re-running the <em>exact</em> same run as many times
as you need.
</p><p>
But there is often no need to run the bug multiple times, since
breakpoints work even when the simulation is running backwards. For
example, to find the code responsible for writing garbage to a
pointer, run forward until your program crashes, then set a write
breakpoint on the (now clobbered) pointer, and run backward; the
breakpoint will trigger at the point in time when the pointer was last
written to.
</p><p>
Simics has a <em>breakpoint manager</em> which stores information
about all breakpoints, of all types. It has commands for listing
breakpoints, enabling, deleting and other common
operations. Breakpoint creation is specific to the different types,
and is described in the following chapters. The breakpoint manager is
the object <code>bp</code>.
</p><p>
In general, breakpoint creation commands return an ID, which can be
used to later delete the breakpoint, or obtain information about it. The most important generic commands are
</p><p>
</p><ul>
    <li><b>bp.list</b>, which lists all breakpoints.</li>

    <li><b>bp.delete</b>, which removes
    a particular breakpoint.</li>

    <li><b>bp.show</b>, which shows more information about
    a particular breakpoint.</li>
</ul> 
<p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="membreak">12.1.1 Memory Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="breakpointmemory"></a>
</p><p>


A memory breakpoint stops the simulation whenever a memory location in
a specified address interval is accessed. The address interval can be
of arbitrary length and the type of memory access can be specified
as any combination of <i>read</i>, <i>write</i>, and <i>execute</i>.
</p><p>
The easiest way to set memory breakpoints is to use the
<b>bp.memory.break</b> command:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>output-radix 16</b>
simics&gt; <b>bp.memory.break p:0x10000</b>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000 in 'board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]' with <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
access mode 'x'
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Prefix the address with <code>p:</code> or <code>v:</code> to get a physical
or virtual address, respectively. As you can see in the following
example, Simics defaults to interpreting a breakpoint address as
virtual if you do not specify otherwise:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]-&gt;current_virtual_context = "board.cell_context"</b>
simics&gt; <b>bp.memory.break v:0x4711</b>
[board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0] info] VMP not engaged. Reason: virtual breakpoint.
Breakpoint 2 set on address 0x4711 in 'board.cell_context' with <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
access mode 'x'
simics&gt; <b>bp.memory.break p:0x4711</b>
Breakpoint 3 set on address 0x4711 in 'board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]' with <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
access mode 'x'
simics&gt; <b>bp.memory.break 0x4711</b>
Breakpoint 4 set on address 0x4711 in 'board.cell_context' with <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
access mode 'x'
Note: overlaps with breakpoint 2
</pre><p>
</p><p>
This way of setting breakpoints will attach them to the memory space
(physical address) or context (virtual address) connected to the
current processor. If this is not exactly what you want, read on.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The current processor can be set with the <b>pselect</b>
command:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>pselect board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Without an argument, <b>pselect</b> prints the current processor:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>pselect</b>
"board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]"
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p></div>Physical memory breakpoints are handled by memory space objects. A
memory space represents a physical address space; they sit between the
processor and the actual hardware devices, for example RAM, that can be
accessed with read and write instructions. Breakpoints are created
with the memory space's <b>break</b> command:
<p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]-&gt;physical_memory</b>
"board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]"
simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0].bp-break-memory address = 0x10000 length = 16 -w</b>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000 in 'board.mb.cpu0.mem[0][0]', <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
length 16 with access mode 'w'
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Virtual memory breakpoints are handled by context objects. A context
represents a virtual address space; you can learn more about them in
chapter <a class="reference" href="symbolic-debugging.html">12.2</a>. Essentially, they provide a level of
indirection between processors and virtual memory breakpoints; a
processor has a current context, which in turn has virtual
breakpoints:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0]-&gt;current_context</b>
"board.cell_context"
simics&gt; <b>board.cell_context.bp-break-memory 0x1ff00</b>
Breakpoint 2 set on address 0x1ff00 in 'board.cell_context' with <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
access mode 'x'
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Note that by default, all simulated processors in a cell
share one context (<b>cell<em>n</em>_context</b>). If you want a virtual
breakpoint to apply only to a subset of the processors, create a new
context just for them:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>new-context foo</b>
simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].set-context foo</b>
simics&gt; <b>foo.bp-break-memory 0xffffffffbfc008b8</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
When creating execution breakpoints, it is possible to specify filter
rules to only trigger when instructions match certain syntactical
criteria. This feature is mainly useful with breakpoints covering
large areas of memory. The available parameters to the break command
are <i>prefix</i> (to match the start of an
instruction), <i>substr</i> (to match a particular substring),
and <i>pattern</i> (to match the bit pattern of the
instruction).
</p><p>
For example, to stop when an instruction with the name <code>add</code> is
executed in a memory range from 0x10000 to 0x12000, use the following
commands:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>bp.memory.break 0x10000 0x2000 -x prefix = "add"</b>
Breakpoint 1 set on address 0x10000 in 'board.cell_context', <img alt="Line break" src="nextline.png">
length 8192 with access mode 'x'
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Simics will now break on the first add instruction encountered (or the
last, if the simulation runs backward). For more information, see the
<em>Simics Reference Manual</em> or use the <b>help bp.memory.break</b>
command.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Temporal-Breakpoints">12.1.2 Temporal Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="breakpointtemporal"></a>
</p><p>
Unlike an ordinary debugger, Simics can handle temporal breakpoints,
i.e., breakpoints in time. Since the concept of time is based on steps
and cycles, to be precise a temporal breakpoint refers to a specific
step or a cycle count as measured by a given processor, but one can also specify breakpoints in seconds of virtual time:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>bp.cycle.break cpu0 100</b>
simics&gt; <b>bp.step.break cpu0 100</b>
simics&gt; <b>bp.time.break cpu0 1</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
In the example above, the breakpoints are specified relative to the
current time. It is also possible to give temporal breakpoints in
absolute time (where 0 refers to the time when the original
configuration was set up in Simics). 
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].bp-break-cycle -absolute 100</b>
simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].bp-break-step -absolute 100</b>
simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].bp-break-time -absolute 1</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The commands <b>bp.cycle.break</b>, <b>bp.step.break</b>
and <b>bp.time.break</b>, can be given without providing the CPU
ad argument. This will set a breakpoint for the current processor.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="control-reg-break">12.1.3 Control Register Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="breakpointcontrol-register-access"></a>
</p><p>
A control register breakpoint triggers when the selected control register is
accessed. The access type is determined by the break command parameters used.
</p><p>
To break on a control register <i>write</i>, use <b>bp.control_register.break</b>.
For example, to break when the register <code>cr0</code> is written to:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>bp.control_register.break name = cr0</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To break on a control register <i>read</i>, use <b>bp.control_register.break -r</b>.
For example, to break when the register <code>cr0</code> is read:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>bp.control_register.break name = cr0 -r</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
A list of available control registers can be obtained by
tab-completing the <i>name</i> argument. See the documentation
for <b>bp.control_register.break</b> in the <em>Simics
Reference Manual</em> for more information.
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="io-break">12.1.4 I/O Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="breakpointIO"></a>
</p><p>
An I/O breakpoint is always connected to a specific device object. The
breakpoint is triggered when that device is accessed. The breakpoint
is set using the <b>break-io</b> command, which take the device
name as a parameter. For example, to break on accesses to a device
called <b>dma</b>, we would use the following syntax:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>break-io device = board.mb.sb.dma</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
A list of devices can be obtained by tab-completing the
<i>device</i> argument.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="text-output-breakpoints">12.1.5 Text Output Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="breakpointtext-output"></a>
</p><p>
Many simulated machines have a <em><a name="textconsole">text
console</a></em>—a terminal window hooked up to a serial port
on the target machine, so that you can type commands to the target and
get replies. In particular x86 systems also often have
a <em><a name="graphics-console">graphics console</a></em>—a window acting as a
monitor to the machine, hooked up to a graphics device on the target
machine, and usually also to keyboard and mouse devices.
</p><p>
A text console can halt the simulation on the occurrence of a given
character sequence in the output; this is called a <em><a name="textoutput-breakpoint">text
output breakpoint</a></em>. This is also possible on a graphics
console when it is running in text mode graphics, assuming that the
graphics device implements this.
</p><p>
To set a breakpoint, use the
command <b>bp.console_string.break <em>console</em> <em>string</em></b>,
which returns a breakpoint id. Simics will stop when <em>string</em>
appears in the output.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
To find out if a specific simulated machine uses these consoles,
look for objects of class <b>textcon</b>
or <b>graphcon</b> in the list provided
by <b>list-objects</b> once the configuration is loaded.</div><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="graphics-breakpoints">12.1.6 Graphics Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p><a name="graphics-breakpoints2"></a>
<a name="breakpointgraphics"></a>
</p><p>
If your target machine has a graphical display (as opposed to just a
text console), you can set graphical breakpoints on it. A graphical
breakpoint is a (small or large) bitmap image and a pair of
coordinates; when the pixels at those coordinates on the simulated
display exactly match the breakpoint image, the simulation will halt.
</p><p>
Graphics breakpoints can be created from the console GUI window, but
the following commands can also be used to save and set breakpoints for a
graphics console:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:gfx-console-save-break-xy-filename-left-top-right-bottom"><b><b><em>gfx-console</em>.save-break-xy <em>filename</em> <em>left</em>
<em>top</em> <em>right</em> <em>bottom</em></b></b></dt><dd>Let the user specify a rectangular area inside the graphics
  console using the top left and bottom right corners coordinates. The
  selected area will be saved as a binary graphical breakpoint file.</dd><dt id="dt:gfx-console-break-gfx-filename"><b><b><em>gfx-console</em>.break-gfx <em>filename</em></b></b></dt><dd>Activate a previously saved breakpoint and return a breakpoint
  id. When a graphical breakpoint is reached, Simics halts execution
  and returns to the command prompt.</dd><dt id="dt:gfx-console-unbreak-gfx-id"><b><b><em>gfx-console</em>.unbreak-gfx <em>id</em></b></b></dt><dd>Delete the breakpoint associated with <em>id</em>.</dd></dl><p></p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Magic-Breakpoints">12.1.7 Magic Instructions and Magic Breakpoints</a></h2>
<p><a name="breakpointmagic-breakpoint"></a>
<a name="magic-breakpoint"></a>
<a name="magic-instruction"></a>
</p><p>
For each simulated processor architecture, a special nop
(no-operation) instruction has been chosen to be a <b>magic
instruction</b> for the simulator. When the simulator executes such an
instruction, it triggers a <code>Core_Magic_Instruction</code> hap and
calls all the callbacks functions registered on this hap.
</p><p>
Since magic instructions are just no-operation instructions on
hardware, you can run code containing magic instructions on hardware
as well as in the simulator, but you will not get any of the extra
behavior Simics implements for the magic instruction.
</p><p>
If the architecture makes it possible, a magic instruction parameter is encoded
as an immediate value in the magic instruction. When the hap is triggered, this
value is passed as an argument to the hap handlers. This provides the user with
a rudimentary way of passing information from the simulated system to
the hap handler.
</p><p>
Magic instructions have to be compiled into the binary files that are
executed on the target. The file <code>magic-instruction.h</code> in
<code>[simics]/src/include/simics/</code> defines a
<code>MAGIC(</code><i>n</i><code>)</code> macro that can be used to place
magic instructions in your program, where <i>n</i> is the
magic instruction parameter value to encode. Some parameter values are
reserved for internal use; see figure <a class="reference" href="#magic_instruction_figure">28</a>
and figure <a class="reference" href="#reserved_magic_numbers_figure">29</a>.
</p><p>
A complete list of magic instructions and the range of the parameter
<i>n</i> is provided in figure <a class="reference" href="#magic_instruction_figure">28</a>.
</p><p>
<a name="magic-instructionpassing-arguments"></a>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The declaration of the macros are heavily dependent on the
compiler used, so you may get an error message telling you that your
compiler is not supported. In that case, you will have to write the
inline assembly corresponding to the magic instruction you want to
use. The <a name="GCC">GCC</a><a name="C-compilerGCC"></a> compiler should
always be supported.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The magic instruction macro is directly usable only from C and
C++; if your program is written in another language, you will have to
call a C function that uses the macro, or an assembly function that
includes the magic instruction. (If the language supports inline
assembly, that can of course be used as well.) For example, in Java it
would be necessary to use the JNI interface. Check your compiler and
language documentation for details.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
(x86 specific) The magic instruction parameter is passed
through the <code>eax</code> register on x86. The <code>eax</code> register
contents is preserved when the magic instruction is emulated by Simics.
Thus the <code>eax</code> register value can be used just after the magic
instruction to extract the magic parameter value from it. The values of the
<code>ebx</code>, <code>ecx</code> and <code>edx</code> registers are undefined
after the magic instruction. Earlier Simics versions had
different definitions of magic instructions for x86. The
old magic instruction can still be used on x86 if
the processor is not running in VMP mode.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
(PowerPC specific) There are two different encodings of the
<code>rlwimi</code>-based magic instruction on PowerPC. On 64-bit models,
the new encoding is always used; it is also the one generated by
the <code>MAGIC()</code> and <code>MAGIC_BREAKPOINT()</code> macros
in <code>magic-instruction.h</code> when compiling 64-bit PowerPC
code. The old encoding is used on 32-bit models when
the <i>old_rlwimi_magic</i> attribute is set. When compiling
32-bit PowerPC code, the macros will use the old encoding unless the
preprocessor symbol <code>SIM_NEW_RLWIMI_MAGIC</code> has been defined.
<p>
It is recommended that the new encoding is used with 32-bit PowerPC
models and code by setting the appropriate attribute and preprocessor
symbol.</p></div><div class="figure" id="magic_instruction_figure">

Here is a simple example of how to use magic instructions:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">#include "magic-instruction.h"

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
        initialize();
        MAGIC(1);                     <i>// tell the simulator to start</i>
                                      <i>// the cache simulation</i>
        do_something_important();
        MAGIC(2);                     <i>// tell the simulator to stop</i>
                                      <i>// the cache simulation</i>
        clean_up();
}
</pre><p>
</p><p>
This code needs to be coupled with a callback registered on the magic
instruction hap to handle what happens when the simulator encounters a
magic instruction with the arguments 1 or 2 (in this example, to start
and stop the cache simulation).
</p><p>
Simics implements a special handling of magic instructions called
<b>magic breakpoints</b>. A magic breakpoint occurs if magic
breakpoints are enabled and if the parameter <i>n</i> of a
magic instruction matches a special condition. When a magic breakpoint
is triggered, the simulation stops and returns to the prompt.
</p><p>
Magic breakpoints can be enabled with the command
<b>bp.magic.break</b> <a name="bp.magic.break"></a>. The
condition on <i>n</i> for a magic instruction to be recognized
as a magic breakpoint is the following:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">n == 0 || (n &amp; 0x3f0000) == 0x40000
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Note that the value 0 is included for architectures where no immediate
can be specified. The file <code>magic-instruction.h</code> defines a
macro called MAGIC_BREAKPOINT that places a magic instruction with a
correct parameter value in your program.
