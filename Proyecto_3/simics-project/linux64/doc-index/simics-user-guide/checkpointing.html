Simics's configuration system can save the complete state of a simulation in a
portable way. This functionality is known as <em>checkpointing</em>, and the
set of files that represent the elements of the systems are called a
<em>checkpoint</em>.
</p><p>
Saving and restoring a checkpoint can be done from the command line with the
<b>write-configuration</b> and <b>read-configuration</b> commands.
</p><p>
A checkpoint consists of the following files, collected under a directory:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    A main <em>configuration file</em>, named <code>config</code>. This
    is a text representation of the objects present in the system.
  </li>
  <li>
    Optional image files (described in section <a class="reference" href="#images">6.2.3</a>), named
    after each respective image object.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Below is a portion of a checkpoint file showing an object. Saved objects are
always represented as <code>OBJECT</code> <em>object-name</em> <code>TYPE</code>
<em>class-name</em> <code>{</code> <em>attributes</em> <code>}</code>. In this case we have
an instance of the <b>DEC21143</b> class (fast Ethernet LAN controller
interfacing the PCI bus) named <b>dec0</b>. 
The attribute <i>pci_bus</i> is used to connect the device to the PCI bus.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">OBJECT dec0 TYPE DEC21143 {
        queue: cpu0

        build_id: 0xbb9
        pci_bus: pci_bus0
        ...
}

</pre><p>
</p><p>
Objects are saved in the main checkpoint file in no specific order.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Compatibility">6.2.1 Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>

Simics maintains checkpoint compatibility with older versions, i.e. it is
always possible to continue using checkpoints created in a previous version of
Simics when upgrading to a new version.
Compatibility is always maintained for one major version older than
the oldest of the supported API versions. For checkpoints older than
that, load the checkpoint with a newer version of Simics and create
a new checkpoint.
</p><p>
The opposite is not true. Trying to
load a checkpoint created in a newer version of Simics than the local version
will typically not work. The same restriction may apply even between minor
Simics releases. For example, a checkpoint created with Simics 3.2.2 is not
guaranteed to load correctly in the older Simics 3.2.1 release.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Attributes">6.2.2 Attributes</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The short example of the <b>dec0</b> description only uses a few types of
attribute values: strings, objects, and hexadecimal integers. The possible
attribute types are:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:string"><b>string</b></dt><dd>Strings are enclosed in double quotes, with C-style control
characters: <code>"a string\n"</code></dd><dt id="dt:integer"><b>integer</b></dt><dd>Integers can be in hexadecimal (<code>0xfce2</code>) or signed
decimal (<code>-17</code>) notation.</dd><dt id="dt:boolean"><b>boolean</b></dt><dd>One of <code>TRUE</code> and <code>FALSE</code>.</dd><dt id="dt:floating-point"><b>floating-point</b></dt><dd>Specified in decimal (<code>1.0e-2</code>) or
hexadecimal (<code>0x5.a21p-32</code>) style, just like in C.</dd><dt id="dt:object"><b>object</b></dt><dd>The name of a configuration object: <code>cpu0</code>.</dd><dt id="dt:list"><b>list</b></dt><dd>Comma-separated list of any attribute values, enclosed in
parentheses.  Example: <code>("a string", 4711, (1, 2, 3), cpu0)</code></dd><dt id="dt:dictionary"><b>dictionary</b></dt><dd>The format is a comma-separated list of key/value
pairs, like in: <code>{ "master-cpu" : cpu0, "slave-cpu" : cpu1 }</code>. The key
should be a string, integer or object, while the value can be of any attribute
type. Dictionaries are typically used to save Python dictionaries in a
checkpoint. Keys must be unique, although Simics does not enforce this.</dd></dl><p>Each attribute belongs to one of the following categories. Note that only
attributes of the first two categories are saved in checkpoints.
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:required"><b>Required</b></dt><dd>Required attributes must be set when creating an
object. They are saved in checkpoints. If you edit a checkpoint, you should
never remove a required attributeâ€”Simics will complain and refuse to load
the checkpoint if you do.</dd><dt id="dt:optional"><b>Optional</b></dt><dd>If no other value is provided, optional attributes take
their default value when the object is created. They are saved in checkpoints,
but if you edit them out they will revert to their default value when the
checkpoint is loaded.</dd><dt id="dt:pseudo"><b>Pseudo</b></dt><dd>Pseudo attributes are not saved in checkpoints and usually
contain read-only information that does not change, or that is calculated when
the attribute is accessed. Pseudo attributes are in some cases used to trigger
state changes in the object when written.</dd></dl><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="images">6.2.3 Images</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics implements a special class called <b>image</b> for objects that
potentially need to save a huge amount of state, like memories and disks. An
image represents a big amount of raw data using pages and compression to
minimize disk usage.
</p><p>
To save space and time, images do not necessarily save their entire
state every time a checkpoint is written. They can work in several ways:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>Images can save their state <em>incrementally</em>. At each checkpoint, an
image saves the difference between its current state and the previously saved
state (either the previous checkpoint or the initial state). This is the
default behavior implemented by Simics. This allows several checkpoints to be
saved and restored using the same base image and a series of difference
files.</li>

<li>Images can save their entire current state in the checkpoint. This
results in an <em>independent checkpoint</em>, which does not depend on
the base image or on earlier checkpoints, and can therefore be easily moved
around or shared. However, independent checkpoints are
typically much larger than incremental ones, and can be time consuming
to save.</li>

<li>Images can be used as <em>read-write</em> media. In that case the
file representing the data is always up to date to the current
state. However, this prevents the image from being used in a
previously saved incremental checkpoint or initial state, since its
contents are modified as the simulation advances. When images are used
in this way, only independent checkpoints can be saved.</li>

</ul>
<p>
It is important to understand that when used in incremental mode, images create
<em>dependencies</em> between checkpoints. A checkpoint can only be loaded if
all previous checkpoints are intact.
</p><p>
As an example, let us have a look at an assumed disk image:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">   ...
}
OBJECT disk0_image TYPE image {
        ...
	files: (("tango1-fedora5.craff", "ro", 0, 0x4c5abc000, 0),
                ("disk0_image.craff", "ro", 0, 0x4c5abc000, 0))
        ...
}
...
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The checkpointed image is based on the file
<code>tango1-fedora5.craff</code>, on top of which is added the file
<code>disk0_image.craff</code> that contains the difference between the
checkpoint and the initial state.
</p><p>
Files like <code>disk0_image.craff</code> are often called <em>diff
files</em> because they contain the difference between the new state and the
previous state.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="checkpoint-path">Image Search Path</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
<em>This section contains more in-depth explanations about image handling that
you may skip when reading this guide for the first time</em>.
</p><p>
When successive incremental checkpoints are saved, an image object may
become dependent on several diff files present in different
directories. To keep track of all files, Simics stores in the
checkpoint a <em>checkpoint path</em> list that contains the absolute
directory paths where image files may be found. Image file names are
then saved as <code>%</code><em>n</em><code>%\</code><em>filename</em><code></code>
where <code>%</code><em>n</em><code>%</code> represents the number of the entry in
the checkpoint path, counting from zero.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Simics's checkpoint path is different from Simics's search path (see
section <a class="reference" href="search-path.html">4.4</a>), although both will be used when looking
for image files, as show below.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Independent checkpoints do not affect the checkpoint path.</div>To summarize, when loading a checkpoint or a new configuration, Simics looks
for images in the following way:
<p>
</p><ul>

<li>If the filename does not contain any path information (like
<code>image.craff</code>) or contains a relative path (like
<code>test\image.craff</code>), the file is looked up
<em>first</em> from the checkpoint directory, <em>then</em> from all
the path entries in Simics's search path, <em>in order</em> (see also
section <a class="reference" href="search-path.html">4.4</a> for more information).

<ol>
 <li><code>C:\checkpoints\test\image.craff</code></li>
 <li><code>[project]\targets\qsp-x86\test\image.craff</code></li>

 <li><code>[project]/targets/qsp-x86/test/image.craff</code></li>
</ol>
</dd></dl><p></p></li>

<li>If the filename contains a checkpoint path marker
(<code>%</code><em>n</em><code>%</code>), the marker is translated using Simics's checkpoint
path and the file is looked up in the corresponding path.
<p>

</ul>
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The reason why Simics's search path is involved in the process is that it
makes writing new configurations easier. Adding a path to the place where all
initial images are located allows you to just specify the image names.</div>
<p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Saving-and-Restoring-Persistent-Data">6.2.4 Saving and Restoring Persistent Data</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="checkpoint"></a>
</p><p>
As an alternative to checkpointing, Simics allows you to only save the
<em>persistent</em> state of a machine, i.e., data that survive when the
machine is powered-down. This typically consists of disk images and flash
memory or NVRAM contents. A persistent data checkpoint is handled exactly like
any other checkpoint and contains the same file set, but only objects
containing persistent data are saved. This persistent data checkpoint can be
loaded on top of a corresponding configuration later on.
</p><p>
The commands <b><a name="save-persistent-state">save-persistent-state</a></b> and
<b><a name="load-persistent-state">load-persistent-state</a></b> respectively save and load the
persistent data in a configuration.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
These commands are often used to save the state and reboot a machine
after the disk contents have been modified. Remember that the target OS
<b>might have cached disk contents in memory</b>. In order to have a clean disk
that can be used at boot, you should synchronize the disk, for example by
running <code>init 0</code> on a Linux target system, or shutting down the operating
system, before you issue the <b>save-persistent-state</b> command.</div>Another option is to use the
command <b><a name="enable-writable-persistent-state">enable-writable-persistent-state</a></b>. It saves a
persistent state and also switches all saved files to be writable, so
that the images are used in read-write mode, as described in section
<a class="reference" href="#images">6.2.3</a>. All changes to the images done during the
simulation are then automatically written to these files, without the
need to explicitly save the state.
<p>
This command can also load a state which already exists, created by
this command. It is meant to be used in a Simics script and
facilitates easy handling of the persistent states, either creating a
new state or loading an existing state.
</p><p>
The states created by <b>enable-writable-persistent-state</b> can
be loaded using <b>load-persistent-state</b>, if read-write mode
is no longer desired. States created
by <b>save-persistent-state</b> are generally not usable
by <b>enable-writable-persistent-state</b>, since it may not be
possible to make them writable.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="modifying-configurations">6.2.5 Modifying Checkpoints</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Checkpoints are usually created by saving a configuration inside Simics, but it
is possible to edit or even create checkpoints yourself. It may even be required to edit file paths in a checkpoint file if it is relocated.
</p><p>
Because a minimal checkpoint only has to include required attributes,
<em>creating a checkpoint from scratch</em> works relatively well for small
configurations. We suggest you use an existing checkpoint as a starting point
if you wish to do that. Note that more advanced layers have been built on top
of the configuration system to make the creation of a new machine much
easier. Refer to section <a class="reference" href="conf-start-scripts.html">6.6</a> for more
information.
</p><p>
<em>Modifying checkpoints</em> require some extra care. Adding or removing
devices may confuse the operating system, which does not expect devices to
appear or disappear while the system is running, and cause it to crash.
</p><p>
Changing the processor frequency may be enough to confuse the operating
system. Many operating systems check the CPU frequency at boot time, and base
their waiting loops and timing on the value they got. Saving a checkpoint and
changing the frequency after boot may affect the simulation and confuse the
system. Devices that use processor frequency to trigger events at specific
times may also behave strangely when the frequency suddenly changes.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Merging-Checkpoints">6.2.6 Merging Checkpoints</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
If you want to make an incremental checkpoint independent from all
previous checkpoints, for example to distribute it, you can use the
small <b>checkpoint-merge</b> program in <code>[simics]\bin</code>
from your system command line. It merges the checkpoint with all its
ancestors to create a checkpoint that has no dependencies. Specify
the checkpoint you want to distribute as the first parameter and the
name of the new stand-alone checkpoint as the second. This tool can be
used in both Linux and Windows environments.
</p><p>
Note that the merged checkpoint still depends on the base image. This
differs from independent checkpoints, which are completely standalone.
