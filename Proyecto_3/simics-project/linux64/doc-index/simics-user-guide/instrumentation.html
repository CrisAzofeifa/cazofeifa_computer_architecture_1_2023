  This section describes the <em>Instrumentation Framework</em> in Simics.
    </p><p>
  Simics' instrumentation framework provides a mechanism for inspecting
  various parts of the running simulated system and features a flexible
  way to dynamically add/remove inspections. The framework is designed
  with performance in mind, allowing fast and parallel execution
  with low latency communication.  
</p><p>
  Unlike most profiling tools, which instrument the target source code
  or object code, Simics can profile a workload non-intrusively. This
  allows you to profile without disturbing the execution. Simics will
  profile arbitrary code, including device drivers, dynamically
  generated code, and code for which you do not have the source. Also,
  unlike most profiling tools, Simics collects profiling data exactly,
  not by sampling the execution and relying on statistics.
  </p><p>
  What information that can be obtained through the instrumentation
  framework depends on how well the devices and other objects have been
  adapted to this new framework. Since the framework is new, only
  some models support instrumentation through various interfaces:
  </p><ul>
    <li>The processor models provide inspection capabilities to
      monitor instruction execution, memory accesses, exceptions,
      register changes etc. Only ARC, ARM, MIPS, PPC, X86 and Xtensa processor
      targets currently support this kind of instrumentation.
    </li>
    <li>The SystemC Library awareness support tracing, breaking and
      custom tools for acting on the basic signals, sockets, event and
      processes that exists in a typical SystemC configuration.
      Please refer to <em>Simics SystemC Library</em>
      documentation for more details.
    </li>
    <li>DML device models will automatically support bank-instrumentation
      allowing register bank accesses to be monitored and controlled.
    </li>
  </ul>
<p>
  Conceptually, Simics instrumentation framework consists of four elements:
  </p><ul>
    <li><b><i>Instrumentation providers</i></b> are models of
      devices, processors, etc., that have been adapted for the
      instrumentation framework.
      Providers supply information on various things happening
      in the model, such as instructions being executed,
      exceptions triggered, or a device register written, etc.</li>

    <li><b><i>Instrumentation tools</i></b> are objects which can
      connect to the providers and request information to be sent
      to them. The tool collects the information and provides
      user-commands for presenting the result.</li>

    <li><b><i>Instrumentation connections</i></b> are 
      the communication channels used when a tool and a provider
      are connected to each other.
    </li>
    
    <li><b><i>Instrumentation filters</i></b> are optional objects
      which can be used by one or several tools. The filters make sure
      the tool only gets parts of the information from the provider
      by enabling or disabling the instrumentation according to      
      the filter algorithm.</li>    
  </ul><br>
<p>
  Figure <a class="reference" href="#instrumentation-ex1">4</a> shows an abstract view of a possible
  setup. The instrumentation provider sends information through an
  instrumentation connection to the tool.  The instrumentation filter
  can decide to disable the gathering of information from the
  provider.  At any point within the simulation the tool can produce
  output for the user on what it has collected.
  </p><p>

      <img alt="" src="instrumentation-ex1.png">
      <div class="caption">Figure 4. Abstract view of instrumentation elements</div>
  </div></div>

<p>
  To concretize the abstract example in a more realistic setup,
  figure <a class="reference" href="#instrumentation-ex2">5</a> shows an "instruction-histogram"
  tool which counts the instructions being executed and their frequency,
  producing a histogram of the most commonly used instructions
  that were executed on this processor (system-wide, that is,
  both instructions in the operating system, kernel threads,
  and all user-level processes are counted).

      <img alt="" src="instrumentation-ex2.png">
      <div class="caption">Figure 5. Simple example</div>
  </div></div>

  <p>
  If only a specific application's instruction mix is of interest,
  we can add a filter to this setup. In figure <a class="reference" href="#instrumentation-ex3">6</a>,
  a process-filter has been setup to monitor the 'perl' application only.
  The process-filter uses the OS-Awareness feature in Simics to get
  information when any perl process is created, scheduled on a certain
  cpu, or die.
  With this knowledge, the process-filter enables and disables
  the instruction-histogram collection. The output from the
  instruction-histogram is now only the instruction mix for the
  perl application(s) that has executed.
  </p><div class="figure" id="instrumentation-ex3">
<div style="text-align: center">  
      <img alt="" src="instrumentation-ex3.png"><br>
      <div class="caption">Figure 6. Simple example with a filter</div>
  </div></div>

<p>
  Filters are orthogonal to the tools, and the tools are themselves
  unaware of any existing filters controlling them. From the tool
  perspective, it is simply someone requesting their connections
  to be disabled or enabled.
</p><p>
  It is possible to have multiple filters controlling
  one tool as shown in figure <a class="reference" href="#instrumentation-ex4">7</a>. This
  allows sophisticated setups for zooming in a specific details
  of the instrumentation gathered.
  </p><p>
  In principle, all tools always have one filter: the user, which
  can use Simics commands to enable or disable the communication manually,
  in a script or in a script-branch.
  By using enable/disable commands in a script branch, the user
  have the possibility to control when the instrumentation should be
  active based on virtual-time, breakpoints triggered etc.
  </p><p>
  As long as all filters enables the tool's connection, it will be
  active.
</p><p>

      <img alt="" src="instrumentation-ex4.png"><br>
      <div class="caption">Figure 7. Multiple filters, all enables</div>
  </div></div>

  <p>
  But as shown in figure <a class="reference" href="#instrumentation-ex5">8</a> when any filter
  decides to disable the connection
  it will become disabled and remain so until all filters
  have enabled it again.
  </p><p>
  </p><div class="figure" id="instrumentation-ex5">
<div style="text-align: center">  
      <img alt="" src="instrumentation-ex5.png"><br>
      <div class="caption">Figure 8. Multiple filters, one disables</div>
  </div></div>

    <p>
  How providers and tools are allowed to be connected depends on
  the tool's requirements of the providers interfaces. That is,
  some tools can only connect to certain providers.
  </p><p>
  It is possible to connect:
  </p><ul>
    <li>Multiple tools to the same provider. Each tool might extract
      the same or different information from the provider and produce
      various valuable output for the user.</li>
    <li>One tool to multiple providers. Collecting system-wide
      statistics. For example, one tool can be connected to all
      processors in an SMP setup.
    </li>
    <li>The same tool to the same provider, multiple times. Where each
      established connection might be configured to extract different
      information</li>
  </ul>
<p>
  An even more advanced example is illustrated the in figure
  <a class="reference" href="#advanced-example">9</a>. In this setup, there are two tools
  working simultaneously, both are connected to the same SMP cluster of
  processors and both are using the same filter which
  tracks the 'perl' application.
