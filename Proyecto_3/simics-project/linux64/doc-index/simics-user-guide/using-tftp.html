<a name="TFTP"></a>
</p><p>
It is possible to transfer
files from the host environment to the target (simulated) machine by
using the TFTP feature provided by the
<b>service-node</b>. Since TFTP executes in lockstep, with
only one packet acknowledged at a time, it is slower than for example
FTP, but it reliably transports files between the host and target
machines.
</p><p>
It is assumed that a service node has been created and connected to the
Ethernet device through an Ethernet link. The following example presents how
TFTP is used on a target machine which is running Linux and has the
<code>tftp</code> program installed. Furthermore, the target machine in this
example is using the IP address 10.10.0.10 and the service node uses 10.10.0.1.
</p><p>
Creating a service node and connecting it to the target machine can be
done with the <b>connect-real-network</b> command. This will also
set up port forwarding to the real network, even though this is not a
requirement for using TFTP:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt;<b> connect-real-network 10.10.0.10</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
After booting the target machine into Linux the first step is to bring up the
network interface that is connected to the service node. At the target prompt,
issue:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer: ~#<b> ifconfig eth0 10.10.0.10 up</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To transfer the file <code>myfile.txt</code> from the host machine,
issue:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">joe@computer: ~#<b> tftp -l myfile.txt -g 10.10.0.1</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The directory that the service node uses to find files downloaded by
the target can be changed with
the <b>&lt;service-node&gt;.set-tftp-directory</b>
command. This also controls where uploaded files are saved. The
default is to search the Simics path, starting with the current
working directory of the Simics process. The search path can be
changed with the <b>add-directory</b> command and can be viewed
with the <b>list-directories</b> command.
