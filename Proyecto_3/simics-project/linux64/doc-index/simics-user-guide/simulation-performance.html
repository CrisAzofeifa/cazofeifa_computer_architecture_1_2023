</p><p>
This chapter covers various topics related to Simics performance and what can
be done to measure and improve it. It discusses the general performance
features provided by Simics. For ways to scale the simulation even
further see chapter <a class="reference" href="scaling-simics.html">17</a>.
</p><p>
Simics is a fast simulator utilizing various techniques such as run-time code
generation to optimize performance. In some cases Simics can execute code
faster than the target system being simulated, while it can also be
considerably slower in other cases.
</p><p>
There are four major <a name="execution-modes">execution modes</a> Simics uses to execute
target instructions: <a name="hypersimulation">hypersimulation</a>, <a name="VMP">VMP</a>,
<a name="JIT">JIT</a> and <a name="interpreted-mode">interpreted mode</a>.
</p><p>
Hypersimulation means that Simics detects repetitive work performed
by the target code and performs the effects of the code without
actually having to run the code. In the most simple case this is a
simple idle loop, but it can also be applied to more complex examples
such as spin-locks and device polling. This is the fastest execution mode.
</p><p>
VMP, which is a part of Simics's x86 models, utilizes the
virtualization capabilities of modern processors to run target
instructions directly. This typically results in high simulation
performance, but the host and target needs have the same instruction
set, and you have to do special set up to enable it. VMP is currently
only supported on x86 hosts.
</p><p>
JIT mode uses run-time code generation to translate blocks of the
target instructions into blocks of host instructions. JIT mode is when
Simics runs such translated blocks. This mode is supported by most
target processor models in Simics.
</p><p>
Interpreted mode interprets the target instructions one by
one. This mode is the slowest, but it is always available.
</p><p>
<br>There are basically two ways to measure Simics performance:
</p><ul>
<li>How fast the instructions are being simulated, typically measured in million
target instructions per host second (MIPS).</li>
<li>How fast the virtual times elapses.</li>
</ul>
In most cases the user is mostly interested in the first. Simics
should execute instructions as fast as possible to finish the workload
in shortest possible time.  However, since Simics is a full system
simulator, it is also important that the virtual time on the simulated
machine advances quickly. That is important in cases where a program
or operating system is waiting on a timer to expire or an interrupt
from a device in order to proceed with the workload.
<p>
If we divide the wall-clock time on the host that Simics executes on, with the
elapsed virtual time on the target machine, we get a slowdown number.
</p><div style="text-align: center">
slowdown = Time<sub>host</sub>/Time<sub>virtual</sub>
</div>
A slowdown number of 2.3 means that Simics performance is 2.3 times slower than
the system it simulates. A slowdown value of less than 1.0 means that Simics
manages to execute the corresponding code faster than the system it simulates.
The slowdown depends on various factors:
<ul>
<li>The performance of the host which Simics runs on.</li>
<li>The application which runs in Simics.</li>
<li>The frequency of the target being simulated.</li>
<li>The simulator time model.</li>
</ul>
The default time model in Simics is that each target instruction takes one target cycle
to execute. That is the default, <i>Instructions Per Cycle</i> (IPC) is 1.0.
This is a simplification (but in many cases an adequate approximation)
compared to the actual time it takes on the real hardware to execute instructions.
It is possible to change the IPC number using
the <b>&lt;cpu&gt;.set-step-rate</b> command. For example:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].set-step-rate ipc = 1.5</b>
Setting step rate to 3/2 steps/cycle
simics&gt; <b>board.mb.cpu0.core[0][0].set-step-rate ipc = 0.5</b>
Setting step rate to 1/2 steps/cycle
</pre><p>
In the first example, IPC of 1.5 means that Simics needs to execute 3
instructions for 2 cycles to elapse. In the second example, for each
instruction executed two cycles elapse. Thus, with a lower IPC value,
virtual time will progress faster and simulation slowdown will
decrease.
</p><p>
Note that there is nothing wrong in changing the default IPC when it comes to
the accuracy of the simulation. In many cases, the IPC observed for a given
benchmark is much lower than the 1.0 that Simics assumes, and matching it will
both make the simulation closer to the real hardware and improve the simulation
speed, at least in virtual time. Simulations that profits most from this change
are simulations involving devices and long memory latencies.
