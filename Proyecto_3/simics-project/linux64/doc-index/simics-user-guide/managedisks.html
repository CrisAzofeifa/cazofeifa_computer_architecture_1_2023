</p><p>
In order to use Simics, you must have <em>images</em> (also called <em>disk
dumps</em>) with the operating system and the applications you plan to
run. Depending on the type of machine you are using, these images will
correspond to the contents of a disk, a flash memory, a CD-ROM, etc. There are
some images provided that work with the example machines located in the
<code>targets</code> directory.
</p><p>
Simics images are usually stored in a special format called <code>craff</code>
(for Compressed Random Access File Format) to save disk space. Simics also
accepts a raw binary dumps as well as VHDX images. The use of a raw dumps
as images can sometimes be more practical if you
are manipulating images outside Simics. Simics comes with the
<code>craff</code> utility to manipulate and convert images in
<code>craff</code> format (see section <a class="reference" href="working-with-images.html#The-craff-utility">7.2.8</a>).
</p><p>
This chapter will explain the following:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

<li>How to use Simics Agent to transfer files</li>
<li>How to use Simics Agent to run commands on target systems</li>
<li>How to work with images in general</li>
<li>How to use CD-ROMs and floppies with Simics</li>
<li>How to use the SimicsFS file system</li>
<li>How to import the contents of a real disk inside Simics</li>

</ul>
<p>
To provide you with a more practical overview, here are the ways you can
install and modify the operating system and the applications you wish to run:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:using-simics"><b>Using Simics:</b></dt><dd><ul>

  <li>You can install a completely new OS or simply copy files using a
  simulated CD-ROM drive, by linking it to a real CD-ROM drive on your host
  machine (Linux only) or by using a CD image file (refer to sections <a class="reference" href="cd-roms-and-floppies.html#Accessing-Host-CDROM">7.3.1</a>
  and <a class="reference" href="cd-roms-and-floppies.html#Accessing-CDROM-image-file">7.3.2</a>).</li>

  <li>You can copy files from the simulated floppy drive by linking it to the
  real host floppy device (Linux only) or by using a floppy image file (see
  sections
  <a class="reference" href="cd-roms-and-floppies.html#Accessing-Host-Floppy">7.3.3</a> and
  <a class="reference" href="cd-roms-and-floppies.html#Accessing-Floppy-Image-File">7.3.4</a>).</li>

  <li>You can use SimicsFS to directly access your host file systems from the
  simulated machine (see section <a class="reference" href="simicsfs.html">7.5</a>).</li>

  <li>
    You can use the <em>Simics Agent</em> application to copy files and
    directories between host and target systems, as well as issuing commands to
    be executed in a shell on the target. Full functionality is available from
    the Simics command line (see section <a class="reference" href="matic.html">7.1</a>).
<p>
    You can also run upload and download commands directly from the command-line
    in the target system shell, using the <em>Simics Agent</em> application.
  </p></li>

  <li>You can download files over the simulated network (see the <em>Ethernet
  Networking Technology Guide</em>).</li>

</ul>
<p>
<b>Do not forget to read more about <em>images</em> in section <a class="reference" href="working-with-images.html#image-modif-save">7.2.2</a> to learn how to save and re-use your
changes.</b></p></dd><dt id="dt:using-external-programs"><b>Using External Programs</b></dt><dd><ul>

<li>You can install a new OS along with new programs on a real machine and
create an image from the real machine storage (disk, flash memory,
etc.). Section <a class="reference" href="copying-real-disks.html">7.8</a> shows how to perform this with
a disk.</li>

<li>You can modify a FAT image directly with Mtools (see section <a class="reference" href="working-with-images.html#mtools">7.2.5</a>). (Linux only)</li>

<li>You can modify an image directly via a loopback device (see section <a class="reference" href="working-with-images.html#Loopback-device-access">7.2.6</a>). (Linux only)</li>

<li>Use a tool such as SFMount from PassMark* Software. (Windows only)</li>
