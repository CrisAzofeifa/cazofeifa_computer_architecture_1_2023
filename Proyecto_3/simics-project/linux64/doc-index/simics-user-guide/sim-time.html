One of the most powerful properties of full-system simulation is that
time inside the simulation and time in the real world are two
completely different things. This brings a number of substantial
benefits:
</p><p>
</p><ul>

  <li>You can pause the simulation at any time, and the software
  running in the simulation simply <em>cannot</em> detect this. This
  allows you to inspect (and optionally modify) the state even at
  points where real hardware would be unable to stop.</li>

  <li>You can save the state of the simulation to disk (this is called
  a <em>checkpoint</em>), and start again from that point at any time,
  any number of times.</li>

  <li>The simulation is completely deterministic. Every time you start
  from the same state (such as a checkpoint), the <em>exact</em> same
  thing will happen. This can be tremendously useful when hunting down
  certain types of bugs.</li>

  <li>The simulation can be reversed, making it possible to answer
  questions such as "This value is garbage now. When did this happen,
  and who did it?"; simply set a write breakpoint and run backward
  until it triggers, and you have your culprit.</li>

</ul>
<p>
These advantages apply to the entire simulated system, whether it is a
single target machine or an entire network.
