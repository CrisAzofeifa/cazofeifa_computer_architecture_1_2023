<p>

The term <i>hypersimulation</i> refers to a simulator feature
which can detect, analyze and understand, frequently executed target
instructions and fast-forward the simulation of these, thus providing the corresponding results more rapidly.
</p><p>
Being able to detect the idle loop (see chapter <a class="reference" href="workload-characteristics.html#idle-loop-performance">16.4.1</a>) is one example of when this technique is
applicable. A much more extreme hypersimulation task would be to
understand a complete program and simply provide the corresponding
result without actually starting the program.  Naturally, this is
hardly ever applicable, and impossible in general. Busy-wait loops and
spin-locks are more realistic examples of cases where it is easy to
optimize away the execution with hypersimulation.
</p><p>
Hypersimulation can be achieved in several ways:
</p><ul>

<li><b>CPU handled instruction hypersimulation</b>: The processor
model can detect certain instructions which will either stop the
execution or jump to itself. This behavior is always enabled,
thus <b>disable-hypersim</b> does not change the behavior.
Only an exception/interrupt will stop this execution.</li>

<li><b>Automatic hypersimulation</b>: Automatic detection of certain
small loops that only wait for a future event to occur. This feature
is only available for some processor models. The <code>-no-auto</code>
switch for the <b>enable-hypersim</b> command disables automatic
hypersimulation.
<p>
</p></li>

<li><b>Hypersim-pattern-matcher</b>: User-written specifications,
hypersim patterns, are used by the simulator to detect waiting loops
that match. The hypersim pattern describes the binary layout of the
instructions in the loop and the conditions for leaving it.
The hypersim-pattern-matcher module contains the framework for
writing hypersim patterns.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The following instructions are handled with <i>CPU handled instruction
hypersimulation</i>:

<p>
Hypersimulation should be as non-intrusive as possible, the only difference
that should be noticeable as a Simics user is the increased performance.
Registers, timing, memory contents, exceptions, interrupts etc. should be
identical.
</p><p>
Hypersimulation using the hypersim-pattern-matcher may have some
intrusions regarding Simics features:
</p><ul>
<li>Device and memory access count will be too low if accesses are optimized away.</li>
<li>Breakpoints inside a hypersim detected code segment will not trigger every time.</li>
<li>Breakpoints on accesses to memory or devices will not hit every time since
many of these accesses can have been optimized away.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Hypersimulation using the hypersim-pattern-matcher is activated by
default, and can be activated/deactivated
with <b>enable-hypersim</b>/<b>disable-hypersim</b>.
</p><p>
The <b>hypersim-status</b> command gives some details on what hypersim
features that are currently active.
</p><p>
Hypersim patterns are typically fragile, since they depend on an exact
instruction pattern. Simply changing the compiler revision or an optimizing
flag to the compiler can break the pattern from being recognized.
</p><p>
The <i>QSP-x86</i> machine does not use hypersim
patterns, but if you have access to the <i>Ebony</i> you
can try the following examples. The example uses
the <code>ebony-linux-common.simics</code> script:

This configuration has a Linux idle loop optimizer by default. We start by disabling
hypersim and execute the code "normally" during boot. After 6 seconds (host) or
12 seconds (virtual) the boot is finished and the operating system starts executing
the idle loop. The idle loop itself is executed quickly in Simics, running at 579 MIPS.
When idling, almost 6 virtual seconds is executed for each host second. That is,
Simics executes 6 times faster than the hardware (the processor is configured to be
running at 100 MHz).
</p><p>
Next, execution is stopped and hypersim is enabled. Now we can see the idle loop optimizer
kicking in. Now 400 virtual seconds is executed each host second, or
about 70 times faster than without hypersim enabled.
