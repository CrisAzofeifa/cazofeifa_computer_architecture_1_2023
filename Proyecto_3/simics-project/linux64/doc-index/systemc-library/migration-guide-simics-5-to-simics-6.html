</p><p>
SystemC Library has been upgraded between Simics 5 and Simics 6 to support
new features and make the product more robust and future proof. See the release
notes for a list of all new features.
</p><p>
Most changes are internal and do not affect the end-user. In addition the
deprecated API has been kept, whenever possible, to maintain backwards
compatibility.
</p><p>
One major change that affects the end-user is how the SystemC scheduler is
integrated with Simics. In Simics 5 the SystemC time was forwarded by events
posted on an external clock, therefore creating and connecting this clock was a
required step.  In Simics 6 the adapter is directly scheduled by Simics and so
no external clock is required. This affects the configuration, and some
migration is required as described below.
</p><p>
Here is the list of things one has to do when migrating from 5 to 6:
</p><ul>
  <li>Adapter <em>always</em> creates an internal clock, so any explicitly
    created external clocks in components or test benches should be removed.</li>
  <li>For the same reason, the adapter's <code>queue</code> attribute must not be
    set explicitly by components or test benches. If set, it will result in an
    error with the following message:
    <em>"VT_set_object_clock() called twice for the object &lt;object name&gt;.
      The function may only be called once for each configuration
      object."</em>.</li>
  <li>In a configuration with other clocks, aside from the one now provided by
    the adapter, extra care must be taken to make sure the adapter ends up in
    the correct cell. Please run <b>check-cell-partitioning</b> to validate
    the configuration.</li>
  <li>Test-benches that run Simics for a specified amount of cycles based on
    the frequency of the external clock, must be updated to run the
    corresponding time in picoseconds instead.</li>
  <li>Custom gaskets must be updated: <b>CatchUp</b> class has been
  removed, and must be removed from the gasket to avoid compilation error.</li>
  <li>Custom adapters calling SimulationInterface directly must be updated to
  avoid compilation error.</li>
  <li>All conf-classes provided by SystemC Library and Tools now use underscore
    instead of deprecated hyphens. Updates may be required depending on
    use-case.</li>
  <li><code>time_quantum</code> attribute removed from Adapter. Updates may be
    required depending on use-case.</li>
  <li>SystemC tools have moved inside SystemC Library and are built as part of
  the Simics module, with tool classes prefixed with the module's name. This in
  order to improve isolation between different Simics modules to avoid problems
  with incompatible C++ ABIs. Updates may be required depending on
  use-case.</li>
  <li>The default tools created by the <b>[trace,break]-sc</b> commands
  have been moved into the internal namespace of the adapter. Please don't use
  this tool directly.</li>
  <li>The <code>systemc2simics::Signal</code> gasket can no longer be bound
  directly to the SystemC sc_out via operator overloading. Instead, calling
  the <code>set_pin</code> method is required. This makes the Signal gasket
  consistent with the other gaskets.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Please also consider the following optional changes:
</p><ul>
  <li>Remove calls to <code>ExtensionSender::set_payload()</code> if not
    required. This is only required when the payload is modified before calling
    methods of the interface-specific <b>Extension</b> class</li>
  <li>Remove calls to <code>Extension::init(sender, payload)</code> with calls to
  <code>Extension::init(sender)</code>.</li>
  <li>In simics2tlm gaskets, replace calls to <code>Gasket::payload()</code> with
  <code>TransactionPool::acquire()</code> and calls
  to <code>Gasket::trigger_transaction()</code> with
  <code>Gasket::trigger(Transaction*)</code>. This will make the gasket re-entry
  safe. See any of the standard gaskets for reference.</li>
  <li>In simics2tlm gaskets, replace calls
  to <code>Gasket::set_inquiry(bool)</code> with
  <code>TransactionExtension::set_transport_debug(bool)</code>. See <b>IoMemory</b>
    gasket for reference.</li>
  <li>Remember to change SIMICS_API from 5 to 6 in the module's Makefile.</li>
</ul>
