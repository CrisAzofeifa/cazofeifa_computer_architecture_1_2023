<p>

</p><ul>
  <li>The kernel must be statically linked with the model in order to satisfy
  the isolation properties expected by all Simics modules</li>
  <li>Awareness for sockets only supports a BUSWIDTH of 32 and 64</li>
  <li>Awareness for processes does not track spawned processes at run-time</li>
  <li>The memory profiling feature does not support threads instantiated using
    SC_CTHREAD. Allocations made by threads instantiated using SC_THREAD are
    supported</li>
  <li>The memory profiling results include allocations made by the SystemC
    kernel</li>
  <li>SystemC adapters from the same (Simics) module cannot be instantiated in
  multiple cells. This limitation comes from the SystemC kernel itself, having
  a global/shared sc_simcontext pointer. Simics supports multiple instances of
  the kernel, by allocating a new context for each instance and updating the
  global context at the enter/exit of each instance. To run the same SystemC
  model in multiple cells, the model must be wrapped in separate modules.</li>
  <li>Similar with the previous limitation, SystemC adapters from the same
  (Simics) module does not work in multicore accelerator mode. </li>
  <li>Static SystemC objects are only supported for the first instance of each
    <b>Adapter</b> created in Simics</li>
  <li>The <b>simics2tlm::Transaction</b> gasket does not support
    checkpointing of asynchronous transactions</li>
  <li>The TLM transaction injected to a multi passthrough initiator socket is
  only sent to the first bound target socket.</li>
</ul>
