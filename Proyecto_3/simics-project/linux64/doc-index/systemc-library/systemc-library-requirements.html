Because C++ does not have a standardized ABI, all SystemC Library modules as well
as all SystemC models built from these modules must be compiled with
exactly the same compiler, compiler version, and compiler flags. It
works perfectly fine to include binary SystemC models as long as they
are Accellera compliant and the compiler guidelines just outlined are
followed.
</p><p>
As of Simics 6 it is also possible to combine Simics SystemC modules compiled
with different toolchains, provided each individual module has been constructed
from a set of binaries built using the same toolchain.
</p><p>
Simics does not guarantee that the Simics SystemC Library API will not
change between releases. Simics' SystemC
support is still being gradually improved and a completely frozen API
would limit what improvements can be made. A lot of effort will,
however, be made to avoid changing the API. If a change is needed, the
end-user effort will be minimized.
