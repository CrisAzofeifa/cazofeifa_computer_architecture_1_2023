<p>

Simics SystemC* Library provides support for creating and
running SystemC models in Simics. SystemC, as standardized by
IEEE-1666, is a C++ class library and a methodology that can be used
to create cycle-accurate or transaction-level models of
hardware. When choosing to develop models in SystemC for use in Simics
it is important to be aware that there exists some fundamental
differences in vocabulary, methodology, and features compared to
writing models directly to the Simics API. While SystemC Library
attempts to minimize those differences it cannot do so completely.
</p><p>
SystemC Library provides three basic capabilities. It makes it
possible to run SystemC models in Simics with only a few minor changes
compared to running a stand-alone SystemC simulation. Note that none of
these changes are to the SystemC model itself. SystemC
Library also provides awareness and inspection capabilities of SystemC
models running in Simics by connecting SystemC
concepts, such as the object hierarchy and the sc_report mechanism to
the corresponding Simics concepts. Support for tracing and breaking on SystemC
ports and exports as well as signals is provided.
Finally, SystemC Library provides a mechanism to
connect SystemC models with traditional Simics models through the use
of interface gaskets.

<p>

SystemC was originally designed to supplement or replace RTL and HDL
modeling with languages such as Verilog or VHDL. One of the goals with
SystemC 2.0 was to enable system-level modeling at a higher level of
abstraction than RTL. In this tradition the SystemC kernel implements
an event based timing model with delta-cycles similar to VHDL
where there is an "outer" simulation loop that drives time forward and
an "inner" loop that stabilizes all signals during the delta-cycles.
</p><p>
Systems modeled in SystemC are made up of a number of SystemC <em>modules</em>
(C++ classes) that are connected at compile-time using ports and signals and
implement their functionality in
<em>processes</em> (C++ methods) and <em>threads</em> (coroutines). A
SystemC module is simply a C++ class derived from <b>sc_module</b>
provided by the SystemC kernel. The module includes processes and
threads that are simply member functions of the class that may be
"registered" as <em>sensitive</em> to a specific port. A port can represent
different "activation signals"; such as the rising and falling of a
clock's edge or, at a higher level of abstraction, an arbitrary C++
type being passed from one module to another via a signal connected to
a port.
</p><p>
To further support system-level modeling the Transaction-level
Modeling (TLM) standard was proposed as an addition to
SystemC. SystemC TLM 2.0 (hereafter TLM2) extends SystemC with
a set of core interfaces, a global quantum for temporal decoupling,
initiator and target sockets, a generic payload and base protocol, and
some utilities.

<p>

This document assumes that the reader has a basic knowledge of
Simics. It is recommended to be familiar with the contents of the
<em>Simics User's Guide</em> and to have performed the introductory steps
in <em>Getting Started with Simics</em>. It is useful if the reader is
able to find relevant information in the <em>API Reference Manual</em>.
At the very least, the reader should be familiar with starting Simics
and loading a configuration.
</p><p>
It is also recommended to be familiar with basic Simics Model Builder
concepts, such as building a module, creating a module test, as well
as familiarity with the C++ API. Please refer to the <em>Model
Builder User's Guide</em> and the <em>C++ Device API Programming Guide
</em> for more information. The reader is expected to be familiar
with SystemC and Transaction-level Modeling (TLM).
</p><p>
This document describes how to run SystemC models in Simics and how to
integrate them with Simics models written for the Simics API. It does
not try to cover how to write good SystemC models. For more details
about SystemC, refer to the IEEE-1666 standard.
</p><p>
This document serves multiple purposes and has been constructed to try to meet
these requirements. It starts out with a brief introduction to SystemC
Library and a quick tutorial on how to get started. This is followed up by a
chapter on how to connect SystemC models with Simics. That chapter starts off
with a hands-on example highlighting all the building blocks including testing
and configuration. The chapter follows up with some guidelines before it goes
into details on how the gaskets work and how users can write their own. The
chapter is rounded off by describing two common gaskets. The next chapter
covers all the features. More advanced topics about how SystemC models are
executed in the Simics simulator is described next. All known major
limitations are listed as a separate chapter. Last chapter is about the
compile-time requirements.
</p><p>
The document can be used both as a tutorial and as reference. It has not been
written in such a way that it would make sense to read it from cover to cover.
