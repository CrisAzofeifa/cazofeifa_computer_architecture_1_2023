The SystemC Library is shipped with source-only. There is no official
binary package to go with it; the lack of a stable C++ ABI prevents this from
being efficiently used in Simics. Instead, the user is responsible for making
sure that the binaries are rebuilt from source every time the <em>Simics Base</em>
package is upgraded.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The default GCC used by Simics SystemC Library is 6.3.0. For maximum
  interoperability, it is recommended to use this compiler version. This is the
  only GCC version tested by Simics regression tests.</div>Standard tools are built as part of each module, and will only work on
conf-objects from that module.
<p>


In order to build a Simics SystemC device module, a set of required libraries
must be provided. These libraries must be built in a specific order. The
libraries also have a fixed Boost version dependency. These things are
described in more details in the upcoming sections.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="boost">8.1 Boost Dependencies</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics SystemC Library depends on Boost C++ (www.boost.org). The Simics
Serialization Library is a fork of Boost version 1.65.1, hence only this
version will work.
</p><p>
The Boost C++ used in Simics SystemC Library is header-only, thus there is no
need to build and link with any Boost libraries.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Intel internal user may have different Boost dependency, check in
 <em>Intel SystemC Library Programming Guide</em> for detail.</div>To let Simics know where Boost is installed, <i>BOOST_INC_PATH</i> needs to be
defined and exported for the <b>make</b> command to succeed. This can, for example,
be done by setting it in the <code>config-user.mk</code> file in your Simics project
directory or by passing it on the command line.
<p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Variables set in <code>config-user.mk</code> must also be explicitly exported:
<pre class="jdocu_small">BOOST_INC_PATH ?= /home/packages/boost/1.65.1/include/
export BOOST_INC_PATH
</pre><p>
</p></div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
It is not an error to provide both <i>BOOST_INC_PATH</i> and
<i>BOOST_PREFIX</i> variables. If both are provided, <i>BOOST_INC_PATH</i> wins.
</div>
<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="order">8.2 Library Order</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="buildingorder"></a>
</p><p>
SystemC libraries depend on each other and must be compiled in the
right order before any SystemC devices may be built. Please build the
SystemC libraries in the following order:
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li><code>SystemC Kernel</code></li>
<li><code>Simics Serialization</code></li>
<li><code>SystemC Checkpoint</code></li>
<li><code>SystemC Library</code></li>
</ul>
<p>
The best way to build all binaries in the correct order, is to invoke the build
script from a Simics project. See <a class="reference" href="#build-script">8.4</a> for more
details.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="build-on-windows">8.3 Building on Windows</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="buildingwindows"></a>
</p><p>
On Windows, SystemC modules can only be built using Visual C++ (provided with
Visual Studio). In order to build SystemC modules using Visual C++, launch the
Visual Studio Command Prompt (x64 version), configure the CC environment
variable to use Visual C++ ('cl'), and build your modules using bin\make.bat.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt;<b>"&lt;path to Visual Studio's vcvars64.bat"</b>
project&gt;<b>set CC=cl</b>
project&gt;<b>bin\make.bat</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The module's makefile will try to detect which Visual C++ version to use by
inspecting the environment variables, set up by the corresponding Visual Studio
Command Prompt. The version can be forced by setting MSVC_VERSION:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt;<b>set MSVC_VERSION=msvc140</b>
-- or --
project&gt;<b>set MSVC_VERSION=msvc170</b>  
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Use of Visual Studio 2010 or 2013 is no longer supported, due to their
lack of C++14 support.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Use of Visual Studio 2017 and 2019 is currently not supported, but it
should be possible to manually convert the solution files and make it work; as
it does work for Visual Studio 2022.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Using MinGW GCC to build SystemC modules on Windows is no longer a
supported feature and does not work.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
DML and C modules must use GCC/MinGW, so if there is a mix of DML/C and
C++/SystemC models in the project, then it is necessary to build the targets
separately.</div><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
Currently the host requires the "8.3 short filename"-support to be
enabled in order for the GNU Make logic to work. See 'fsutil 8dot3name' on
<a class="jdocu" href="https://docs.microsoft.com" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_top">https://docs.microsoft.com</a> for more details on how to query and
enable this.</div>
<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="build-script">8.4 Build Script</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="buildingscript"></a>
Simics provides a build script that makes it easy to compile all the SystemC
libraries from a Simics project. The script is located in the <code>bin</code>
subdirectory of the Simics installation, and is invoked like this:
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Usage">Usage</a></h3>
<p>

<p>
   
   </p><dl><dt id="dt:h-help"><b><code>-h, --help</code></b></dt><dd>Show help message and exit.</dd><dt id="dt:f-force"><b><code>-f, --force</code></b></dt><dd>Force rebuild of all the libraries.</dd><dt id="dt:u-unittests"><b><code>-u, --unittests</code></b></dt><dd>Build and run unit tests.</dd><dt id="dt:j-jobs"><b><code>-j, --jobs</code></b></dt><dd>Run up to N build jobs in parallel.</dd><dt id="dt:m-make"><b><code>-m, --make</code></b></dt><dd>Specify which GNU Make binary to run. Defaults to 'make'</dd><dt id="dt:"><b><code>...</code></b></dt><dd>The rest are parsed as make options for the modules.</dd></dl><p>
</p><p>
The script will copy all the required SystemC modules and build them in the
correct dependency order. The SystemC module makefiles needs CC, CXX and
BOOST_PREFIX variables defined. For better support of Valgrind additionally
export the variable SYSTEMC_VALGRIND_CFLAGS.
The build and support of the SystemC Checkpoint
Library can be disabled by defining the variable USE_SIMICS_CHECKPOINTING=no.
The build and support of the SystemC CCI Library can be disabled by defining
the variable USE_SIMICS_CCI=no.
The user can either set and export the variables in
the <code>config-user.mk</code> file, provide them as script parameters or set
them as shell environment variables. Once the script has completed, the user
is ready to build other SystemC modules in the project.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The script must be run in the root directory of the Simics project associated
with a Simics installation.</div><div class="note">

This section contains build instructions for the individual components within
the SystemC Library solution. The best way to build these is to run the
build script. See <a class="reference" href="#build-script">8.4</a> for details.
</p><p>
Reduce the compilation times of SystemC libraries by setting the
<i>SYSTEMC_NO_UNITTESTS</i> variable. When set, no unit tests are
compiled and run for those libraries that contain them.

<p>

<a name="buildingsystemc-kernel"></a>
In order to run SystemC models in Simics, the Simics SystemC Kernel
must be used.
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
SystemC Kernel is distributed as source, and must be built along
  with the other components including the device modules using the same

<b>Note:</b>
Building the kernel using a different GCC toolchain than the one used by
  Simics, usually also requires building the rest of the

also required. These are the steps to build SystemC Kernel from
a Simics Project:
</p><h5 class="jdocu"><a name="Building-On-Linux">8.5.1.1.1 Building On Linux</a></h5>
<p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt; <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=systemc-kernel</b></pre><p>

</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt; <b>bin\make systemc-kernel</b></pre><p>
You will need to set the CC to point to the Visual C++ compiler. See
<a class="reference" href="#build-on-windows">8.3</a> for more details.



</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="building-the-serialization-library">8.5.2 Building the Simics Serialization Library</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="buildingserialization-library"></a>
Simics Serialization Library is a fork of Boost Serialization, which
provides extended serialization support to be used with SystemC
Checkpoint Library.
</p><p>
To build Simics Serialization Library from source:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt; <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=serialization</b></pre><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt; <b>make serialization</b></pre><p>

<a class="reference" href="#building-the-systemc-kernel">8.5.1</a> for more details.
SystemC Checkpoint Library is used by SystemC Library to
provide checkpointing support, but it can also be used on its own. See
the SystemC Checkpoint Library Programming Guide for more details.

the same toolchain.
</p><p>
To build Simics SystemC Library from source:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt; <b>bin/project-setup --copy-module=systemc-library</b></pre><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">project&gt; <b>make systemc-library</b></pre><p>
This will use the default compiler of the system. To use a different compiler, set the CC and CXX flags:

<h3 class="jdocu"><a name="errors-when-building-the-systemc-libraries">8.5.5 Errors When Building the SystemC Libraries</a></h3>
<p>

<a name="buildingerror"></a>
</p><p>
Many errors when building the SystemC libraries are caused by unresolved
dependencies like Boost (see <a class="reference" href="#boost">8.1</a>), or not following the
particular order (see <a class="reference" href="#order">8.2</a>) to build the SystemC libraries. The
best way to build all binaries in the correct order, is to invoke the build
script from a Simics project. See <a class="reference" href="#build-script">8.4</a> for more details.
</p><p>
The script must be run once again with --force option every time the <em>Simics
 Base</em> package is upgraded. If you failed to do this, you will probably see an
undefined symbol error like this when loading your SystemC device module:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">Undefined symbol: _ZN6simics7systemc16SCL_VERSION_5108C1Ev</pre><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The number 5108 shown in the error message depends on the SystemC Library
  version which may differ in real cases.</div>There are also compile-time checks that will take effect when compiling the
Simics modules using the SystemC libraries. These checks verify that the
libraries have been build with the same compiler as is used to build the Simics
module.
<p>


</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="library-cache">8.6 Cached libraries</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
In order to save time when working in multiple Simics projects, building the
libraries in each project can be avoided by using a cache. The build system
supports this through the following scheme:
</p><ol>
  <li>Build the libraries by running the build script in a project</li>
  <li>Copy the libraries and the generated headers for the compile-time checks,
    i.e. everything under <code>&lt;host&gt;/lib/systemc</code>, to a shared location</li>
  <li>Add the following to config-user.mk:<br> <code>export
  SYSTEMC_DEPS_CACHE=&lt;path to cache&gt;</code></li>
  <li>Build SystemC Simics modules using GNU Make as normal</li>
</ol>
