<p>

</p><p>
The simplest case of running a SystemC model in Simics is to run it
without any connections to models written in other languages, a so
called <em>SystemC-only</em> model. When working with the proof of
concept implementation of SystemC provided by Accellera it is common
to build an executable by providing an implementation
of <b><i>sc_main</i></b> that assembles the model hierarchy, starts the
simulation, and performs any cleanup actions. Because of the dynamic
nature of Simics the model will be a Simics module instead of a
standalone application. This allows Simics to instantiate one or more
copies of the model at run-time using the normal Simics configuration
mechanisms. To achieve this the <b><i>sc_main</i></b> function is replaced by a
Simics configuration object. The purpose of this object is the same as
<b><i>sc_main</i></b>: create the model hierarchy, provide a way to start
the simulation, and perform any cleanup. The difference is that now
the object hierarchy is created when the Simics object is instantiated
and the cleanup is done when the Simics object is
destroyed. Simulation control is also handled by Simics, using
standard Simics commands such as <b>continue</b>
and <b>stop</b>.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Standalone-application">3.1 Standalone application</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Here a standalone application refers to an executable that runs in its own
process without Simics. Typically, <b><i>sc_main</i></b> is implemented as the
entry point to the application.
</p><p>
Running a SystemC model in Simics does not affect the model's behavior and this
fact can be leveraged when integrating models with Simics. It is recommended to
first verify that the functionality is as expected by running the model as a
standalone application before integrating with Simics. The verification is
typically done using a SystemC test bench, which may be reused later as a
Simics model test.
</p><p>
To get started with a SystemC-only model in Simics it is best to begin
with a simple example. Create a new SystemC-only model in your project
by issuing the command:
<code><b>./bin/project-setup --sc-only-device empty-device-sc-only</b></code>
</p><p>
This command copies a SystemC-only model skeleton from the installation into the
module directory of the project with the name <code>empty-device-sc-only</code>.
</p><p>
The <b>empty-device-sc-only</b> module contains a very simple
SystemC device, in three source files: <code>sc-device.h</code>,
<code>sc-device.cc</code>, and <code>sc-main.cc</code>. Compiled
together, these three files contain all the relevant code to run the
simulation standalone, i.e., as a separate application outside of
Simics. The Makefile for this standalone application is not provided but
is easy to write since the only dependency for this module is the SystemC
kernel. The entire source code is shown below.
</p><p>
</p><ul><li><code>sc-device.h</code></li></ul>

 <pre class="jdocu_small">#ifndef EMPTY_DEVICE_SC_ONLY_SC_DEVICE_H
#define EMPTY_DEVICE_SC_ONLY_SC_DEVICE_H

#include &lt;systemc&gt;

SC_MODULE(DeviceModel) {
  public:
    SC_CTOR(DeviceModel) : count_(10) {
        SC_THREAD(run_test);
    }

    void set_count(int count) { count_ = count; }
    int get_count() const { return count_; }

 private:
    void run_test();

    int count_;
};

sc_core::sc_module *setup(int argc, char *argv[]);
void teardown(sc_core::sc_module *top_level);

#endif  </pre><p>

</p><ul><li><code>sc-device.cc</code></li></ul>

 <pre class="jdocu_small">#include "sc-device.h"

namespace {
const char *const TAG = "intel/empty-device-sc-only/info";
}

void DeviceModel::run_test() {
    while (--count_ &gt;= 0) {
        SC_REPORT_INFO(TAG, "Looping...");
        wait(sc_core::sc_time(500, sc_core::SC_NS));
    }
}

sc_core::sc_module *setup(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    DeviceModel *top = new DeviceModel("top");
    if (argc &gt; 1) {
        int count = atoi(argv[1]);
        top-&gt;set_count(count);
    }

    return top;
}

void teardown(sc_core::sc_module *top_level) {
    delete top_level;
}
</pre><p>

</p><ul><li><code>sc-main.cc</code></li></ul>

 <pre class="jdocu_small">#include "sc-device.h"

int sc_main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    sc_core::sc_module *top_level = setup(argc, argv);
    // coverity[fun_call_w_exception]
    sc_core::sc_start();
    teardown(top_level);

    return 0;
}
</pre><p>

</p><p>
This device has a counter which counts down every 500 nano seconds.
When it counts down, a message as shown below is printed to the standard output.
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">  Info: intel/empty-device-sc-only/info: Looping...
</pre><p>
By default, the above message is printed 10 times since counter is initialized
to 10 in the constructor. This value can be modified by passing an integer
argument when the application is executed.
</p><p>
Now that we have verified the functionality of this simple SystemC device,
let's move on to next section on how to run it in Simics. The same behavior will
be observed when it runs in Simics.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Running-in-Simics">3.2 Running in Simics</a></h2>
<p>

To create a Simics module instead of a standalone application, the
file <code>sc-main.cc</code> is replaced with a similar entry-point
that defines a Simics class instead of creating an application.

 </p><pre class="jdocu_small">#include &lt;simics/systemc/sc_factory.h&gt;
#include "sc-device.h"

#define CLASS_NAME "empty_device_sc_only"
#define CLASS_DESC "example SystemC device"
#define CLASS_DOC  "The &lt;class&gt;" CLASS_NAME "&lt;/class&gt;" \
    " class runs a SystemC-only device in Simics."

simics::systemc::RegisterModel model(CLASS_NAME, CLASS_DESC, CLASS_DOC,
                                     setup, teardown);
</pre><p>

</p><p>
The example above may need some explanation. It registers a new
configuration class with Simics. The name of the class
is <b>empty_device_sc_only</b> and the documentation and short
description are provided by the <em>CLASS_DOC</em> and <em>CLASS_DESC</em>
constants. The class is registered by creating an instance of
the <b>simics::systemc::RegisterModel</b> in the file scope,
that is as a global or static variable, or in a unnamed
namespace. When the module is loaded into Simics, all objects defined
in file scope will be constructed and the <b>model</b> object will
take care of registering the <b>empty_device_sc_only</b> class
with Simics. Simics will now know how to instantiate this class, which
in turn will be responsible for instantiating the rest of the SystemC
subsystem, as defined by the provided <b><i>setup</i></b> function. When
the configuration object is destroyed, the
registered <b><i>teardown</i></b> function, if any, will be called with
the return value of <b><i>setup</i></b>. The return value
from <b><i>setup</i></b> and the argument to <b><i>teardown</i></b> can be a
pointer to any type, the only restriction is that they have to
match. It is also possible to have a <code>void</code> return value
from <b><i>setup</i></b>, in which case <b><i>teardown</i></b> does not take
any arguments.
</p><p>
The device can be built by running <code><b>make empty-device-sc-only</b></code>
in the top-level project directory. Refer to the
<em>Model Builder User's Guide</em> for more details.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
No binaries are shipped from the Simics package. Therefore, these
  binaries must be built before any device modules
  can be constructed. See <a class="reference" href="building-required-libraries.html">8</a> for more
  details.</div>
To test the device in Simics it is necessary to instantiate it. This
is easily done from the Simics CLI, by calling
the <b><i>SIM_create_object</i></b> function via the Python API:
<pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>@SIM_create_object('empty_device_sc_only', 'dev')</b>
&lt;the empty_device_sc_only 'dev'&gt;
</pre><p>
</p><p>
To see what objects exist in the simulation,
the <b>list-objects</b> command can be used:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>list-objects substr = dev -recursive</b>

In this example <b>dev</b> is the Simics configuration object that
wraps the SystemC subsystem, <b>dev.top</b> is the SystemC device
returned by <b><i>setup</i></b>, and <b>dev.top.run_test</b> is the
thread process in dev.top that will call <b><i>SC_REPORT_INFO</i></b> and
print the "Looping..." output shown in the example output below.
</p><p>
The <b>dev.engine</b>, <b>dev.vtime</b> and their sub-objects are
Simics helper objects and can be ignored.
</p><p>
Before running the simulation, turn up the log-level to 2 or higher in
order to show reports of INFO type and normal verbosity:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; <b>dev.log-level 2</b>
