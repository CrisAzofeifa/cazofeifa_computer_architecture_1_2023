<p>

</p><p>
This guide explains how to setup Windows kernel debugger for use with
the Windows OS on Simics-simulated Intel Architecture systems.
</p><p>
It is assumed that the reader has a reasonable understanding of Windows OS
architecture, Windows debugging techniques and Windows kernel debugging 
techniques in particular. It is also assumed that the reader has familiarity
with Windows command line tools, such as <code>bcdedit.exe</code>.
</p><p>
Simics supports connecting the Windows debugger client to the
target kernel debugger over a network connection.
</p><p>
The Windows kernel debugging connection topology does not
have to be run on a single computer. Simulation, serial connection proxy
and Windows debugger client could be all running on separate computer systems.
However this guide focuses on a topology hosted in a single computer system,
which means that all components involved in the Windows kernel debugging session
are running on the same physical host computer system. Furthermore, this host is
assumed to be running Windows 7 or later.
</p><p>
Instructions on how to configure distributed Windows kernel debugging topologies
are outside of scope of this guide.

<b>Note:</b>
Windows kernel debugging in Simics is a rather challenging task. The Windows
  kernel debugger client - <code>windbg.exe</code> -  runs on the host and uses
  real time, while the Windows kernel debugger (a Windows kernel component) runs
  inside the Simics simulation and uses the simulated clock. The two time bases
  can drift apart and create timing issues when the debugger client communicates
  with the kernel debugger.
<p>
  Furthermore, various parameters of the simulation, such as, simulated
  processor speed, stepping rate, number of simulated logical cores, etc., are
  significant factors affecting the Windows kernel debugging session. 
</p><p>
  All of these circumstances can negatively influence the Windows kernel
  debugging experience and will require more knowledge and skill to use Windows
  kernel debugging successfully when compared to Windows kernel debugging on a
  physical system.
