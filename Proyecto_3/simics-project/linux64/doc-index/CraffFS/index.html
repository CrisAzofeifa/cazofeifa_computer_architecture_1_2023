Most large data files in Simics, such as disk images, are stored in
the compressed random access file format (CRAFF). In order to
manipulate the raw data in these files it is necessary to decompress
the file using the <code>craff</code> tool. For disk images these files can be
very large, so decompressing them is not always feasible. Therefore,
we provide an alternative in the experimental CraffFS tool. With
CraffFS you can "mount" the craff file and access it through the
file system as if it is a normal raw file. The CraffFS tool is only
available on Linux and is provided AS IS.
</p><p>
CraffFS requires <code>libfuse</code> version 2.x.x (tested with
2.9.9) and <code>libvtutils</code>.
</p><p>
The synopsis of craff-fs is as follows:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"># ./bin/craff-fs 
craff-fs file mountpt [fuse-opts]
</pre><p>
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a class="not-numbered" name="Example">Example</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
This examples shows how to "mount" a craff image of a disk image in
order to expose it as raw data without decompressing it and then mount
the resulting file via loop back in order to access the disk's file
system. Mounting craff files as raw files does not require root
privileges, but mounting loop back mounting the result usually
does. In this example, there is a craff image of a disk containing an
Ubuntu installation of Linux for the x86 based "Viper" target.
</p><p>
The first step is to mount the craff file with CraffFS to be able to
access the raw data.
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"># <b>./bin/craff-fs targets/x86-x58-ich10/images/viper-ubuntu-10.10.craff craff-mnt</b>
</pre><p>
</p><p>
The mount point will now be populated with two
files: <code>data</code> and <code>info</code>.
</p><p>
Other users (including root or users with administrator privileges)
cannot access the information mounted under craff-mnt mount point:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">$ <b>ls craff-mnt</b>
ls: cannot access 'craff-mnt': Permission denied
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Details about the user, group and file permission cannot be accessed
by other users (including root).
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">$ <b>ls -l</b>
d????????? ? ?           ?               ?            ? mnt_point/
</pre><p>
</p><p>
If other users should access the mount point, "allow_others" should be
uncommented from <code>/etc/fuse.conf</code> file. This will enable all users
(including root) to list/view the contents.
</p><p>
The <code>data</code>
file contains the raw data that makes up the craff file,
the <code>info</code> file contains additional information about the
craff file in text format:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"># <b>cat craff-mnt/info </b>

<p>

</p><p>
Since a disk image will have different partitions at different offsets
it is not possible to mount the "disk image". It is necessary to mount
the individual partitions. There is a tool called <code>parted</code>
that can display this information.

CraffFS allows mounting as read-write and read-only. File systems
successfully tested: ext2, ext3, ext4, NTFS, FAT32.
</p><p>
It can be seen from the example above that the first partition has an
ext4 file system and it starts at 1048576 bytes offset. This
information will be required to mount that partition via the loop back
device.
</p><p>

Mount as read-only:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"># <b>mount -o ro,loop,offset=1048576 craff-mnt/data /mnt/</b>
# <b>ls /mnt/</b>
bin    dev   initrd.img  lost+found  opt   sbin     sys  var
boot   etc   lib         media       proc  selinux  tmp  vmlinuz
cdrom  home  lib64       mnt         root  srv      usr
# 
</pre><p>
</p><p>
Mount as read-write:
</p><p>
</p><pre class="jdocu_small"># <b>[sudo] mount -o rw,loop,offset=1048576 craff-mnt/data /mnt/</b>
# <b>ls /mnt/</b>
bin    dev   initrd.img  lost+found  opt   sbin     sys  var

</pre><p>
</p><p>
Mount command used with options (-o) requires administrator
privileges. If the craffFS command is run without administrator
privileges, even if mount command is run as root, mounting will
fail. There are two options:
</p><p>
</p><ol>
<li> Run both CraffFS and mount commands as root.</li>
<li> Run CraffFS as normal user but edit <code>/etc/fuse.conf</code>
and uncomment "allow_others". Root (and other users) can mount and
access mounted files.</li>
</ol>

</p><p>
Craff files will increase in size as files and information is written,
but the file will not automatically decrease if same files or others
are removed/deleted. To shrink the craff file size after delete,
create an zero file (full of zeros) until the end of the partition and
use the <code>craff</code> tool. This tool will ignore all zero blocks
and will shrink the craff file.
