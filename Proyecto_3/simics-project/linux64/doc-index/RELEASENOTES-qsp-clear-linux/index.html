<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This document identifies important information for the QSP Clear Linux Package
package for Simics 6. All users of this specific package
should review this document carefully.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Minor-Changes-Since-Simics-6.0.0">Minor Changes Since Simics 6.0.0</a></h2>
<p>

The following is a list of changes since the initial Simics
6.0.0 release.
</p><p>
</p><ul><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6110"></a>6.0.10 (build 6110)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li>Simics no longer comes with documentation
  in PDF format.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6082"></a>6.0.7 (build 6082)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li>Documentation in HTML format has been added.
  </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6050"></a>6.0.6 (build 6050)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li> Fixed a problem on Windows where the
    installer still asked for
    the Model Builder key (bug #SIMINT-1236). </li><li> Support for Python 2.7 has been removed.
    Simics now only embeds
    a Python 3 interpreter. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6030"></a>6.0.5 (build 6030)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li> The separation of source code into separate
    packages has been
    removed. Source code is now included directly into
    each package. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6028"></a>6.0.4 (build 6028)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li> The installers for Linux and macOS have
    been updated.
    Support for fallback mode of decryption keys has
    been removed. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6021"></a>6.0.3 (build 6021)
</p><ul><li><b>QSP Clear Linux</b><ul><li> The Clear Linux image was updated. The
    updated image got a few utilities
    installed like telnet and ping. SimicsFS was reconfigured for users'
    convenience. E.g., access to the <tt>/host</tt> directory
    is allowed for a user account now. SSH daemon on the image was configured
    to allow login with an empty password as well as login by the "root" user.
    Also, automatic time synchronization
    with time servers on the Web was disabled to avoid undesired date changes
    and unwanted network traffic. The released image has two accounts
    configured: "root" and "simics". Both accounts have empty passwords.
    Please use older versions of the package if previously shipped image files
    are needed (bug #SIMICS-13675). </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6015"></a>6.0.2 (build 6015)
</p><ul><li><b>QSP Clear Linux</b><ul><li> The Clear Linux used in the package was
    updated. Please use
    older versions of the package if previously shipped image files are
    needed. The released image has two accounts configured: "root" and
    "simics". Both accounts have empty passwords. </li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6006"></a>6.0.0 (build 6006)
</p><ul><li><b>QSP Clear Linux</b><ul><li> The first release of the package. The
    <tt>cl-lite-b27930.craff</tt>
    image contains a pre-installed Clear Linux distribution. The system
    was configured for use with the QSP-x86 and x58-ICH10 virtual platforms.
    Username/password for a regular user account is "simics"/"simics",
    for a super-user account - "root"/"root". </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

This section briefly describes the known limitations of the
QSP Clear Linux Package package. Please refer to section
<a class="reference" href="#Detailed-List-of-Limitations">x</a> for a more technical
description.

<p>

This section describes in detail the known limitations of the
QSP Clear Linux Package package. Please refer to
section <a class="reference" href="#Limitations">x</a> for a more general description.
</p><p>
A register or field marked as <i>Not implemented</i> is present with
read-write semantics but has no side effects on simulation. A register
marked as <i>Not implemented (design limitation)</i> has the same
semantics as a "Not implemented" register and there is no
plan to extend the model with this functionality. A register with
<i>Lack of documentation</i> has not been implemented because there is
no available documentation describing its semantics.
