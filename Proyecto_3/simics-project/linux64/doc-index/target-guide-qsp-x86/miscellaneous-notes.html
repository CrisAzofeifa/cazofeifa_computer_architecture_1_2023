<p>
    
    If you have problems typing in the password when logging in
    because the simulated machine times out too quickly you can issue the
    Simics command:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; enable-real-time-mode
</pre><p>
    This will cause Simics not to run faster than the wall clock.
    Normally this is not a problem and it will only happens when the x86 processor
    is sitting idle on a HLT instruction.
</p><p>
    For NetBSD, you will also need to lower the check interval to
    avoid repeated keystrokes:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; enable-real-time-mode check_interval=100
</pre><p>
</p><p>
    To run as fast as possible again you simply run the command:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; disable-real-time-mode
</pre><p>
    See the Reference Manual for further information.
    </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Console-input">4.2 Console input</a></h2>
<p>
    
</p><p>
    Certain key combinations are normally caught by the host operating
    system or the window manager and may have dangerous side effects. An
    example is the ctrl + alt + del combination used to bring up the task
    manager on Windows and to reboot Linux systems. Such key combinations
    can be safely inserted using Simics commands instead.
</p><p>
    For example to send ctrl + alt + del:
    </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simics&gt; board.console.con.input -e "C-A-Del"
    </pre><p>
</p><p>
    Regular strings can also be issued:
    </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    simics&gt; board.console.con.input "mkdir foo\n"
    </pre><p>
</p><p>
    </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Absolute-Positioning-Pointer">4.3 Absolute Positioning Pointer</a></h2>
<p>
      
</p><p>
    Without the connection of the USB tablet device, only the relative
    coordinates of the mouse can be reported to the graphical console.
    So if the simulated console and the real desktop disagree about the mouse
    acceleration or position, you will get seemingly erratic mouse behavior
    which is common and very irritating.
</p><p>
    To resolve the problem, you can connect the USB tablet device by setting
    the parameter <b>connect_usb_tablet</b> to <code>TRUE</code>. Then in the Simics
    target script, enable the absolute pointer like this:
    </p><pre class="jdocu_small">    if ($connect_usb_tablet == TRUE) {
        $console.con-&gt;abs_pointer_enabled = TRUE
    }
    </pre><p>
</p><p>
    Now the absolute mouse coordinates will be reported, which means that the
    mouse pointer is exactly at the point where it is on the real desktop. You
    can then start Simics and the mouse movement in the graphical console
    should become normal.
</p><p>
    
    </p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Changing-the-Processor-Clock-Frequency">4.4 Changing the Processor Clock Frequency</a></h2>
<p>

<a name="configurationtips"></a> 
<a name="processor-clock-frequency"></a>
<a name="interactive-use-of-simulated-machines"></a>
</p><p>
The clock frequency of a simulated processor can be set arbitrarily in
Simics.  This will not affect the actual speed of simulation, but it
will affect the number of instructions that need to be executed for a
certain amount of simulated time to pass.  If your execution only
depends on executing a certain number of instructions, increasing the clock frequency will take
the same amount of host time (but a shorter amount of target
time). However, if there are time based delays of some kind in the simulation,
these will take  longer to execute. 
</p><p>
At a simulated 1 MHz, one million target instructions will correspond to a
simulated second (assuming the simple default timing of one cycle per
instruction). At 100 MHz, on the other hand, it will take 100 million
target instructions to complete a simulated second. So with a higher clock
frequency, less simulated target time is going to pass for a certain
period of host execution time.
</p><p>
If Simics is used to emulate an interactive system (especially one
with a graphical user interface) it is a good idea to set the clock
frequency quite low.  Keyboard and mouse inputs events are handled by
periodic interrupts in most operating systems, using a higher clock
frequency will result in longer delays between invocations of periodic
interrupts.  Thus, the simulated system will feel slower in its user
response, and update the mouse cursor position etc. less frequently.
If this is a problem, the best technique for running experiments at a
high clock frequency is to first complete the configuration of the
machine using a low clock frequency.  Save all configuration changes
to a disk diff (like when installing operating systems).  Then change
the configuration to use a higher a clock frequency and reboot the
target machine.
</p><p>
Note that for a lightly-loaded machine (for example, working at an
interactive prompt on a serial console to an embedded Linux system),
Simics will often execute quickly enough at the real target clock
frequency that there is no need to artificially lower it.

	</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Sample-Core-Timing-Model">4.5 Sample Core Timing Model</a></h2>
<p>
	  
	  The sample-core-timing model is a simple instrumentation tool that can adjust the timing
	  based on what goes on in a core. The code can serve as an example on one way to extend a
	  functional simulation with approximate timing.
</p><p>
	  The model works by running a number of instructions fast while collecting information about
	  what goes on in what is called a period. Then the core is stalled to make the core's time match
	  the calculated number of cycles for the instructions retired during the period.
</p><p>
	  The provided example model collects read and write operations, total number of instructions
	  and number of instructions of a configurable set of instruction classes.
	  This will not give any real timing information since the inner workings of a modern core
	  is much more complicated.
</p><p>
	  Activity<br>
	  The tool can also calculate activity to provide a base for power and temperature modeling.
	  Activity is calculated in a similar way to the cycles but also include a base activity per cycle.
	  Again, these numbers will not match the real thing but can be used to exercise power management code.
</p><p>
	  To create a sample-core-timing model and attach it to the core(s)
	  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; new-sample-core-timing-tool name = timing -connect-all
	  </pre><p>
</p><p>
	  This will create a central tool called timing and one timing-model object per core.
</p><p>
	  All the standard commands for instrumentation tools can also be used with sample-core-timing.
	  See instrumentation chapter in the Simics User Guide for more information on the instrumentation
	  framework.
</p><p>
	  There are a number of commands in the tool to help set it up. With the commands
	  <b>set-base-cycles-per-instruction</b> and <b>set-base-activity-per-instruction</b>
	  the number of cycles and amount of activity used for each instruction is set. With
	  <b>set-base-activity-per-cycle</b> a background activity that is added per cycle can be set.
	  Both cycles and activity can be specified as floating point numbers. Default for the activity
	  settings is 0 but for cycles default is 1 cycle per instruction.
</p><p>
	  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; timing.set-base-cycles-per-instruction cycles = 0.5
simics&gt; timing.set-base-activity-per-instruction activity = 227.4
simics&gt; timing.set-base-activity-per-cycle activity = 4.56
	  </pre><p>
</p><p>
	  Read and write operations can add both extra cycles and activity. The commands
	  <b>set-cycles-per-read</b>, <b>set-activity-per-read</b>, <b>set-cycles-per-write</b>
	  and <b>set-activity-per-write</b> are used to configure those settings.
	  Default cycle and activity values are 0.
</p><p>
	  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; timing.set-cycles-per-read cycles = 0.11
simics&gt;	timing.set-activity-per-read activity = 34.5
simics&gt;	timing.set-cycles-per-write cycles = 0.27
simics&gt; timing.set-activity-per-write activity = 128.3
	  </pre><p>
</p><p>
	  Instruction classes<br>
	  In this context an instruction class consists of a substring and adjustment settings for cycles
	  and activity. Since base-cycles and base-activity are specified for all instructions, this is a
	  way to tune for particular sets of instructions. To help set up there are a couple of commands.
</p><p>
	  With <b>add-instruction-class</b> a new instruction class is added. The adjustment values
	  for cycles and activity can be either positive or negative. The activity value can be omitted
	  which is the same as setting it to 0.
</p><p>
	  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; timing.add-instruction-class instruction = "div" extra_cycles = 0.7 extra_activity = 328
simics&gt; timing.add-instruction-class instruction = "nop" extra_cycles = -0.25 extra_activity = -118
simics&gt; timing.add-instruction-class instruction = "xmm" extra_cycles = 0 extra_activity = 147
simics&gt; timing.list-instruction-classes
	  </pre><p>
</p><p>
	  Finally, there are two commands to inspect what the sample-core-timing models have found out.
	  The <b>list-performance-metrics</b> lists IPC, instructions per cycle, and activity per cycle
	  for the last period and average IPC and activity per cycle for the whole time the model has been
	  enabled.
	  The <b>list-metrics</b> lists all the internal metrics accumulated in the timing models.
</p><p>
	  </p><pre class="jdocu_small">simics&gt; timing.list-performance-metrics
simics&gt; timing-list-metrics
	  </pre><p>
</p><p>
	  Telemetry from the timing model can be retrieved through the telemetry-interface.
	  Three different telemetry-classes are provided.
	  A notification called "isim-telemetry-update" is notified when there is new data
	  to look at.
