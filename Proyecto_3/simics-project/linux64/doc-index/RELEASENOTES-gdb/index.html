</p><p>
This document identifies important information for the 
package for Simics 6. All users of this specific package
should review this document carefully.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Minor-Changes-Since-Simics-6.0.0">2 Minor Changes Since Simics 6.0.0</a></h2>
<p>

The following is a list of changes since the initial Simics
6.0.0 release.
</p><p>
</p><ul><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6216"></a>6.0.0 (build 6216)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li>Simics no longer comes with documentation
  in PDF format.</li><li>Documentation in HTML format has been added.
  </li><li> Fixed a problem on Windows where the
    installer still asked for
    the Model Builder key (bug #SIMINT-1236). </li><li> Support for Python 2.7 has been removed.
    Simics now only embeds
    a Python 3 interpreter. </li><li> The separation of source code into separate
    packages has been
    removed. Source code is now included directly into
    each package. </li><li> The installers for Linux and macOS have
    been updated.
    Support for fallback mode of decryption keys has
    been removed. </li></ul></li><li><b>GDB</b><ul><li> GDB is now distributed in a separate
   package, <code>Simics GDB</code> with package number <code>1031</code>.
  </li><li> GDB now has basic support for DML 1.4
      models and 1.4 syntax. Within GDB, performing DML casts, assignments, and
      little-endian bitslices are now supported, and indices are now implicitly
      provided to any method calls (bug #SIMICS-19386).
  </li><li> Fixed a bug where DML parameters referencing
      the device instance could not be accessed within GDB.
  </li><li> GDB now supports models compiled with
      <code>--split-c-file</code>.</li><li> GDB version is now 12.1
  (bug #19351).</li><li> Fixed a problem on Linux, where
  the gdb binary was linked to the wrong version
  of <code>libncurses</code>.</li><li> Internal changes to GDB build
  structure. </li><li> Corrected error on Windows where it was not
      possible to call functions from GDB prompt. </li><li> Updated GDB to link dynamically and use
    python 3.7.  Added copyrights for readline and
    ncurses. </li><li> The GDB distributed with Simics has been
    updated to version 8.3. </li><li> GDB can again correctly load and view
    information about DML devices with object arrays
    (bug #SIMICS-13278). </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>

</p><p>
This section briefly describes the known limitations of the
 package. Please refer to section
<a class="reference" href="#Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5</a> for a more technical
description.
</p><p>
For model oriented packages, additional limitations may be found in
the model target guides.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5 Detailed List of Limitations</a></h2>
<p>

This section describes in detail the known limitations of the
 package. Please refer to
section <a class="reference" href="#Limitations">4</a> for a more general description.
</p><p>
A register or field marked as <i>Not implemented</i> is present with
read-write semantics but has no side effects on simulation. A register
marked as <i>Not implemented (design limitation)</i> has the same
semantics as a "Not implemented" register and there is no
plan to extend the model with this functionality. A register with
<i>Lack of documentation</i> has not been implemented because there is
no available documentation describing its semantics.
