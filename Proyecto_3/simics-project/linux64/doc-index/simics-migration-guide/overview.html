</p><p>
This chapter gives a short overview of the process of updating code and scripts
from any older Simics version to the most recent one. The following chapters,
on the other hand, contain version specific descriptions.
</p><p>
It is assumed that the migration is from Simics 5 or Simics 4.8, the two
supported Simics versions at the time of the Simics 6 release.

  <li>
    First make sure that any C/C++, DML and Python modules compile with the most
    recent API in the version of Simics that you are migrating from. In Simics
    5, set <code>SIMICS_API</code> to <code>5</code> in the module
    <code>Makefile</code> and correspondingly for Simics 4.8. If the code does not
    compile cleanly, consult the <em>Migration Guide</em> for that Simics
    version. When moving to Simics 5, you should always start with modules
    that are updated to use the most recent API in the Simics version you
    migrate from.
  </li>

  <li>
    Update Python modules to the most recent API in the version of Simics
    that you are migrating from. This can be done by importing the Simics API
    using a specified version:
    <pre class="jdocu_small">import simics_5_api as simics</pre><p>
    This will simplify the migration of code to a newer version of Simics later.
  </p></li>

  <li>
    Run all scripts in Simics with the <code>-wdeprecated</code> command
    line flag to the Simics binary. This will catch uses of some
    deprecated features that can only be detected in run time. An
    alternative is to set the
    <i>simâ†’deprecation_level</i> attribute to 2.
  </li>

  <li>
    When all modules and scripts run fine using the most recent API in
    the old version of Simics, it is time to migrate to Simics
    6. Update the existing project to point to a Simics 6
    installation or, even better, create a new project for Simics 6
    development, since the old project may be needed for comparison
    purposes.
  </li>

  <li>
    Build all modules using the API version corresponding to the
    Simics version that you are migrating from. This should simply be
    a recompilation, since the old API version is already selected in
    the Makefiles and Python source files.
  </li>

  <li>
    In a few cases there are API changes that the pre-processor cannot
    hide.  They may cause the build to fail even when an old API is
    selected. Use the table in chapter <a class="reference" href="deprecation-table.html">8</a>
    and the version specific migration chapters
    <a class="reference" href="5.html">4</a> and <a class="reference" href="4.8.html">5</a> to figure out what changes
    are necessary.
  </li>

  <li>
    Run all your tests and scripts to ensure that everything works in
    Simics 6 when using the old API. Make sure to pass
    <code>-no-wdeprecated</code> to suppress deprecation warnings in the
    process. Once everything works, you can start using the new
    version of Simics for actual work. The following steps are
    optional at this point, but still strongly recommended.
  </li>

  <li>
    Change the API used for modules and scripts to the most recent version,
    one module or script at a time. Update the code according to the following
    chapters.
  </li>

  <li>
    Turn off the <code>-no-wdeprecated</code> flag when running tests and scripts.
    Update any code that yields deprecation warnings according to the
    following chapters.
  </li>
