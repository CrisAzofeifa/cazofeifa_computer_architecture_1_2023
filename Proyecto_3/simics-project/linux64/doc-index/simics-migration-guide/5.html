<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="5">4 Migrating from Simics 5</a></h1>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="5-sections">4.1 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  This chapter describes how to port device models, components, and scripts to
  Simics 6 from Simics 5. For information about what is new in Simics 6,
  read the product release notes.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Object-Initialization-Order">4.2 Object Initialization Order</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  In Simics 5, objects are initialized using a deterministic, but undefined,
  ordering. In Simics 6, the object initialization algorithm has changed
  to always initialize objects in alphanumeric order, with parents being
  initialized before children. Device models that happened to work
  because of a particular device ordering in Simics 5, may break with
  Simics 6. Such device models should be fixed to not
  access uninitialized objects, e.g. by making proper use of
  <b><i>SIM_require_object</i></b>.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Components">4.3 Components</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  Simics 6 has native support for <em>Hierarchical Objects</em>. Support
  for an object hierarchy was previously provided by, and restricted to,
  the component system. The internals of the component system has been
  modified extensively to work with the native object hierarchy,
  and components that depend on undocumented or unsupported features
  can break in Simics 6. Below is a list with some things that
  could cause issues:
</p><ul>
  <li>Object aliasing should be avoided in Simics 6. Object aliasing
    occur when a single object is assigned to more than one component slot.</li>
  <li>Object arrays are implemented using <b>index-map</b>
    objects in Simics 6. Code which depend on object arrays being
    implemented by Python arrays can break.</li>
  <li>The algorithm for assigning queues to components and their objects
    have been changed to be more predictable. Several broken
    corner cases have also been fixed.</li>
  <li>The ordering used when finalizing component connections has
    been changed to be more predictable.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Updating-Processor-Core-Models">4.4 Updating Processor Core Models</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
When creating processor core models with Simics 6, or when integrating
them into a platform, the following points should be taken into
consideration:
</p><ul>
  <li>
    Support for the obsolete <code>memory_page</code> API has
    been removed. Models should make use
    the <code>direct_memory</code> interface instead.
  </li>
  <li>
    CPU models are required to allow event posting
    at cycle 0 even in the situation when the CPU is in the middle
    of an instruction.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="New-Processor-API">4.5 New Processor API</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
Processor core models in Simics 6 should preferably use
the <b>clock-extension</b> extension class instead of
implementing the <code>cycle</code> interface directly.
Using the new CPU API is not a strict requirement, but it
has several benefits:
</p><ul>
  <li>The new <b><i>SIM_transaction_wait</i></b> functionality is only
    supported for CPUs using the new API.</li>
  <li>The new API is easier to use, with less risk for errors.</li>
  <li>Switching to the new API is a pre-requisite for providing
    <em>Multicore Accelerator</em> support.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="New-Target-Consoles">4.6 New Target Consoles</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  Simics 6 introduces new target consoles, which are native to
  the Simics GUI instead of relying on <code>xterm</code>. Please
  refer to Chapter <a class="reference" href="consoles-migration.html">6</a> for more details.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Stall-CPU-Modules-have-been-Removed">4.7 Stall CPU Modules have been Removed</a></h2>
<p>
  
</p><p>
  From Simics 6, the CPU modules comes only in one variant, the "fast" one.
  Consequently, "turbo" has been removed from the file names of CPU modules.
</p><p>
  Simics 5, and earlier, provided two modules per CPU, a "stall" module and a
  "fast" module, where the "fast" file had "turbo" in its name. With the added
  instrumentation and stalling support, there is no longer any need for the
  "stall" module.
