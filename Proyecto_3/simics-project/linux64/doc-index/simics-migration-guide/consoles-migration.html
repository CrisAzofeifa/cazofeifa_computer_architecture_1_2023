<p>

</p><p>
Simics 6 introduces new target consoles, which integrates into the
Simics GUI instead of relying on <code>xterm</code> (on Linux). They have a variety
of new features.
</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>
    There are new text console and graphics console
    classes, <b>textcon</b> and <b>graphcon</b>, part
    of the base package. The earlier separate telnet and host-serial
    consoles are now part of the text console class, which has telnet
    and host-serial servers. The graphics console has a new VNC server.
  </li>
  <li>
    To migrate to the new consoles, change the components created in
    Simics start scripts from the old consoles to the new
    consoles. The new components are <b>txt_console_comp</b>,
    which replaces <b>text_console_comp</b>,
    and <b>gfx_console_comp</b>, which
    replaces <b>graphics_console_comp</b>
    and <b>text_graphics_console_comp</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new components are defined in the <code>console-components</code>
    module, part of the base package.
  </li>
  <li>
    The distinction between graphics and text graphics is no longer
    visible at the component level, but is handled within the console: when the
    graphics device is in text mode, this is detected by the console and
    in the console GUI it becomes possible to mark and copy text.
  </li>
  <li>
    To use the telnet and host-serial servers,
    see <b>&lt;textcon&gt;.telnet-setup</b> and <b>&lt;textcon&gt;.host-serial-setup</b>. To use the VNC server, see <b>&lt;graphcon&gt;.vnc-setup</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new text console no longer takes simulated input via
    attributes. Instead it implements the <code>con_input</code>
    interface. However, the <b>&lt;textcon&gt;.input</b> command is the
    same. Similarly, the graphics console implements
    the <code>con_input_code</code> interface, but still has
    the <b>&lt;graphcon&gt;.input</b> command.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new text console does not translate LF (0xA) to CR (0xD) in
    simulated input.
  </li>
  <li>
    The new graphics consoles supports text breakpoints, similar to
    the text consoles, if the attached VGA device implements the
    required interfaces (and only when running in VGA text
    mode). Hence the <b>&lt;graphcon&gt;.break</b> command now creates text
    breakpoints, and graphics breakpoints is created
    using <b>&lt;graphcon&gt;.break-gfx</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The graphics breakpoints no longer stores comments, so the
    arguments to <b>&lt;graphcon&gt;.save-break-xy</b> have changed.
  </li>
  <li>
    The command for creating screen shots is now
    called <b>&lt;graphcon&gt;.screenshot</b>
  </li>
  <li>
    In general, the new component parameters are not exactly the same as the old
    ones, and neither are the attributes and CLI commands on the
    console classes. See the reference manual for more details.
  </li>
</ul>
