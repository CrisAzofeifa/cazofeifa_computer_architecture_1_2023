<h1 class="jdocu"><a name="compatibility">2 Compatibility</a></h1>
<p>

</p><p>
This chapter describes the compatibility Simics provides and how to keep
scripts, modules and checkpoints from previous versions of Simics working in
new versions.
</p><p>
Simics is ABI backward compatible between minor versions (third digit change).
As a result, user-written modules can be moved to a newer minor Simics release
without recompilation. Any exceptions to this rule are clearly noted in the
release notes.
</p><p>
Simics is also API backward compatible between major releases, up to
two releases back. A module written for an older version of Simics can
be recompiled in a newer Simics version by selecting the appropriate
older API. This must be explicitly requested in the module makefile,
as described in this chapter.
</p><p>
Simics maintains backward compatibility for checkpoints one major version older
than the oldest of the currently supported API versions, i.e. Simics 6 supports
loading checkpoints from versions 5, 4.8 and 4.6. This assumes that the
model also supports older checkpoints.
</p><p>
</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Supported-Simics-API">2.1 Supported Simics API</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
The API consists of all functions which have a <code>SIM_</code> prefix, as well as and types required by those functions. There are
also some internal functions prefixed <code>VT_</code> and <code>DBG_</code> that are
not supported and usually not documented.
</p><p>
The Simics API can be accessed from C/C++ by including one of the
<code>simics/device-api.h</code>, <code>simics/processor-api.h</code> and
<code>simics/simulator-api.h</code> header files, or in DML by including the
corresponding files. There are also several additional header files defining
Simics <em>interfaces</em>. The Simics specific memory allocation functions
defined in <code>simics/alloc.h</code> are also supported.
</p><p>
Part of the Simics API is only available when programming in Python. The
supported classes and functions belonging to the Simics Python API are listed
in the <em>Simics API Reference Manual</em>.
</p><p>
Simics also defines some utility functions in <code>simics/utils.h</code>, that
can be useful when programming in C/C++. These functions are currently
<em>not</em> part of the supported Simics API.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="API-Deprecation">2.2 API Deprecation</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Features marked as deprecated in a particular major Simics version
are, as far as possible, supported in several subsequent major releases. Using
only non-deprecated features of one Simics release guarantees that an
upgrade to the next major version will be without major hurdles.
</p><p>
Starting in Simics 7, features can also be marked as <i>legacy</i>
in a particular major Simics version. Such features continue to exist
until further notice, but are typically not supported for use in
new functionality, and receive only critical bug fixes. Legacy
features may be re-classified as deprecated in a future major version.
</p><p>
The lifespan of a SIM-prefixed API call is:
</p><dl><dt id="dt:major-release-a-supported"><b>Major release A: Supported</b></dt><dd>The function is a fully supported feature. Most features remain supported
for all major releases and are never deprecated.</dd><dt id="dt:major-releases-b-deprecated-or-legacy"><b>Major releases B: Deprecated or Legacy</b></dt><dd>Documented as deprecated or legacy but still supported. Using
deprecated functionality generates both compile-time and run-time
warnings, which helps in migrating from deprecated API calls. When
applicable, documentation in the form of release notes or porting
guides points to replacement functionality. Using legacy functionality
do not generate any warnings.
<p>
By default, deprecated functionality cannot be used when building modules. It
is however still available by explicitly specifying an older major
version as the API version, see Section <a class="reference" href="#migrating-modules">2.3</a>.</p></dd><dt id="dt:major-release-c-removed-or-still-legacy"><b>Major release C: Removed or still Legacy</b></dt><dd>Deprecated
features are removed in the subsequent major version. Legacy features
remain (but can be re-classified as deprecated).</dd></dl><p>Calls with other prefixes such as <code>VT</code> or <code>DBG</code>
do not necessarily follow the same process.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="migrating-modules">2.3 Compiling Modules Written for an Older Simics Version</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
Modules from older versions must specify what API they are written for
by setting the make variable <code><a name="SIMICS_API">SIMICS_API</a></code>. This
variable must have one of the following values:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:latest"><b><code>latest</code></b></dt><dd>Use the most recent Simics API.</dd><dt id="dt:6"><b><code>6</code></b></dt><dd>Compile module for the 6 API.</dd><dt id="dt:5"><b><code>5</code></b></dt><dd>Compile module for the 5 API.</dd><dt id="dt:4-8"><b><code>4.8</code></b></dt><dd>Compile module for the 4.8 API.</dd></dl><p>In order to simplify upgrades to the future major Simics releases, it
is recommended that this variable be set even when writing new
modules. The recommendation is to always specify an explicit version
number, not use <code>latest</code>.
</p><p>
</p><h3 class="jdocu"><a name="find-deprecated">2.3.1 Migrating Modules to the Most Recent Simics Version</a></h3>
<p>

</p><p>
Simics features are added and improved with every product release. At
major releases some features may be deprecated in favor of improved
implementations or solutions to the same problem.
</p><p>
Although the recommendation for developers is to avoid such deprecated
features, they may continue to work in future releases. In these cases 
Simics provides both compile-time and run-time checks for use of deprecated
features. The compile-time checks make deprecated parts of the API not visible
during module compilation, resulting in compilation errors or warnings when
such parts are being used. The compile time checks work for modules written in
C or DML, but not for modules written in Python. To enable the compile-time
checks, set the <code><a name="SIMICS_API2">SIMICS_API</a></code> make variable to the version of
the new Simics release, for example <code>6</code>:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">    SIMICS_API = 6
</pre><p>
</p><p>
A run-time check triggers when a feature is actually being
used. Run-time checks complement compile time checks, since not all
checks can be done statically. For example, static checking can not
capture if passing a NULL pointer in an argument is deprecated.
</p><p>
The following Simics command-line options are related to warnings
about deprecated features:
</p><p>
</p><dl><dt id="dt:wdeprecated"><b>-wdeprecated</b></dt><dd>Issue a warning when a deprecated feature is used, or in many
cases when a used feature will become deprecated in the next major
release. This is equivalent to setting
the <i>sim→deprecation_level</i> attribute to 2.</dd><dt id="dt:no-wdeprecated"><b>-no-wdeprecated</b></dt><dd>Never warn for use of deprecated features. This is equivalent to setting the <i>sim→deprecation_level</i> attribute to 0.</dd></dl><p>The default warning level, if none of the above flags is given, is for
the <i>sim→deprecation_level</i> attribute to have the
value 1. The resulting behaviour is to warn about all used features
that were deprecated in the latest major release, but to issue no
warnings about deprecations that will appear in the next major
release.
</p><p>
</p><div class="note">
<b>Note:</b>
The compile-time and run-time checks does not catch all uses of
deprecated parts of the API. Direct accesses to struct and enum members
are not caught. Check the reference documentation to find deprecated
struct and enum members. Most direct accesses to members in structs
defined in the Simics API are deprecated. </div>

<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="migrating-python">2.4 Running Python Code Written for an Older Simics Version</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
To run a Python module, or some other Python code, that was written for an
older Simics version, the old API module has to be included early in the Python
source file. To run Python code written for Simics 4.8, add the following line:
</p><pre class="jdocu_small">import simics_4_8_api as simics
</pre><p>
and then access old API functions as <code>simics.SIM_old_function()</code>, for
example.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Build-Environment-Compatibility">2.5 Build Environment Compatibility</a></h2>
<p>
 Only the make variables, and
makefiles described in the <em>Model Builder User's Guide</em> are
supported. User written scripts and makefiles that rely on the internals of the
Simics makefiles and other parts of the build environment may break in future
Simics versions.
