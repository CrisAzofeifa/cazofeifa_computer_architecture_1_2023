<h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Introduction">1 Introduction</a></h2>
<p>

</p><p>
This document identifies important information for the Crypto Engine
package for Simics 6. All users of this specific package
should review this document carefully.
</p><p>

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Minor-Changes-Since-Simics-6.0.0">2 Minor Changes Since Simics 6.0.0</a></h2>
<p>

The following is a list of changes since the initial Simics
6.0.0 release.
</p><p>
</p><ul><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6203"></a>6.0.1 (build 6203)
</p><ul><li><b>Cryptographic and secure hash library</b><ul><li> OpenSSL has been updated to
  version 3.0.8. </li><li> The included OpenSSL libraries are
  now stripped of debug symbols. </li><li>Added support for the SM3 digest
  and HMAC in the <code>crypto_engine_openssl</code> device
  (bug #14017737921).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p><a name="__rn_build_id_6200"></a>6.0.0 (build 6200)
</p><ul><li><b>Common</b><ul><li>Simics no longer comes with documentation
  in PDF format.</li><li>Documentation in HTML format has been added.
  </li><li> Fixed a problem on Windows where the
    installer still asked for
    the Model Builder key (bug #SIMINT-1236). </li><li> Support for Python 2.7 has been removed.
    Simics now only embeds
    a Python 3 interpreter. </li><li> The separation of source code into separate
    packages has been
    removed. Source code is now included directly into
    each package. </li><li> The installers for Linux and macOS have
    been updated.
    Support for fallback mode of decryption keys has
    been removed. </li></ul></li><li><b>Cryptographic and secure hash library</b><ul><li>Fix ECC error handling (bug #13010148628). </li><li> OpenSSL has been updated to
  version 3.0.7. </li><li> OpenSSL has been updated to
  version 3.0.5. </li><li> The <code>rsa</code> interface
  is deprecated, use the <code>rsa_v2</code> interface
  instead. </li><li> Add ChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation (bug #22015079405). </li><li> Added new F8 and F9 interfaces which
    accept raw IV (bug #18019345865). </li><li> Add new GCM interface that can
    optionally accept pre-counter block (J0) in place of IV
    in crypto-engine (bug #18019348100). </li><li> Fix AES-XTS failed if data not aligned
  with sector size (bug #1308689141).</li><li> Added support for SHA-512/224 and
  SHA-512/256 (bug #18015581865).</li><li> Added new RSA interface which
      allows use of arbitrary public exponents
      (bug #18014529484).</li><li> Fix AES-XTS decryption bug
    (bug #16012293682). </li><li> Added support for the ZUC-256 algorithm
    (bug #14012682216). </li><li> Fixed a problem where Simics crashed when
    the <code>crypto-engine</code> module was loaded, on Ubuntu
    18 (bug #16010803916). </li><li> Add new AES-XTS interface that supports
    128-bit initialization
    vectors (bug #18011028786). </li><li> Added support for SHA3-224 and SHA3-384
    (bug #22010396610). </li><li> Updated ECDSA crypto to store the result
    even in the case of a
    failure.  This is required because some FW wants to check the
    result itself.  The return code in this case is -2 instead of -1
    on failures where the result is <i>not</i> reported. </li><li> Improved performance by allocating
    log-strings only when necessary. </li><li> Reverted a fix from last build causing a
    regression in AES-CBC crypto
    when running encrypt/decrypt with zero length. This is now a NOP instead
    of an ASSERT (bug #1306290968). </li><li> Implementation updated to address issues
    flagged by Coverity static
    analysis. </li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>

</p><p>
This section briefly describes the known limitations of the
Crypto Engine package. Please refer to section
<a class="reference" href="#Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5</a> for a more technical
description.
</p><p>
For model oriented packages, additional limitations may be found in
the model target guides.

</p><h2 class="jdocu"><a name="Detailed-List-of-Limitations">5 Detailed List of Limitations</a></h2>
<p>

This section describes in detail the known limitations of the
Crypto Engine package. Please refer to
section <a class="reference" href="#Limitations">4</a> for a more general description.
</p><p>
A register or field marked as <i>Not implemented</i> is present with
read-write semantics but has no side effects on simulation. A register
marked as <i>Not implemented (design limitation)</i> has the same
semantics as a "Not implemented" register and there is no
plan to extend the model with this functionality. A register with
<i>Lack of documentation</i> has not been implemented because there is
no available documentation describing its semantics.
